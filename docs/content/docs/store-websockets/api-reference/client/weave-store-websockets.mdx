import { TypeTable } from "fumadocs-ui/components/type-table";

## Overview

The WeaveStoreWebsockets class is a client-side store implementation in the Weave.js ecosystem
that enables real-time collaboration using WebSockets. It connects to a compatible WebSocket
serverâ€”such as [WeaveWebsocketsServer](/docs/store-websockets/api-reference/server/weave-websockets-server)
to sync shared canvas state across all connected users.

Built on top of Yjs and y-websocket, it acts as a bridge between the client-side Weave.js app and the
remote backend, handling updates, awareness (presence), and document syncing with minimal setup.

## Import

```shell
import { WeaveStoreWebsockets } from "@inditextech/weave-store-websockets/client";
```

## Instantiation

```ts
const store = new WeaveStoreWebsockets(storeOptions: WeaveStoreOptions, websocketOptions: WeaveStoreWebsocketsOptions);
```

## Parameters

<TypeTable
  type={{
    ["storeOptions.getUser"]: {
      required: true,
      description:
        "A function that returns a WeaveUser as definition of the metadata of the user that connects to a room",
      type: "() => WeaveUser",
    },
    ["storeOptions.undoManagerOptions"]: {
      description: "An object that defines the Undo-Redo manager options",
      type: "WeaveUndoManagerOptions",
    },
    ["websocketOptions.roomId"]: {
      required: true,
      description: "Room id that we want to join",
      type: "string",
    },
    ["websocketOptions.wsOptions"]: {
      required: true,
      description: "WebSocket underlying client properties",
      type: "{ serverUrl: string; }",
    },
    ["websocketOptions.callbacks"]: {
      description: "Callbacks defined for the instance",
      type: "WeaveStoreWebsocketsCallbacks",
      default: "{}",
    },
  }}
/>

## TypeScript types

```ts
type WeaveStoreWebsocketsConnectionStatusKeys =
  keyof typeof WEAVE_STORE_WEBSOCKETS_CONNECTION_STATUS;
type WeaveStoreWebsocketsConnectionStatus =
  (typeof WEAVE_STORE_WEBSOCKETS_CONNECTION_STATUS)[WeaveStoreWebsocketsConnectionStatusKeys];

type WeaveStoreWebsocketsCallbacks = {
  onConnectionStatusChange?: (
    status: WeaveStoreWebsocketsConnectionStatus
  ) => void;
};

type WeaveUser = {
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

type WeaveUndoManagerOptions = {
  captureTimeout?: number;
  trackedOrigins?: Set<any>;
};

type WeaveStoreOptions = {
  getUser: () => WeaveUser;
  undoManagerOptions?: WeaveUndoManagerOptions;
};

type WeaveStoreWebsocketsOptions = {
  roomId: string;
  wsOptions: {
    serverUrl: string;
  };
  callbacks?: WeaveStoreWebsocketsCallbacks;
};
```

## Events

### onStateChange

```ts
onStateChange: WeaveStoreOnStateChangeEvent;
```

The `onStateChange` event is called when the shared-state changes.

### onRoomLoaded

```ts
onRoomLoaded: WeaveStoreOnRoomLoadedEvent;
```

The `onRoomLoaded` event is called when the room shared-state is loaded.

### onUndoManagerStatusChange

```ts
onUndoManagerStatusChange: WeaveStoreOnUndoRedoChangeEvent;
```

The `onUndoManagerStatusChange` event is called when the undo/redo manager changes.

### onNodeChange

```ts
onNodeChange: WeaveStoreOnNodeChangeEvent;
```

The `onNodeChange` event is called when there is a single node selected and the node changes.

## Methods

#### connect

```ts
connect(): void
```

The `connect` method is called when an user tries to join a room.

#### disconnect

```ts
disconnect(): void
```

The `disconnect` method is called when an user leaves a room.

#### setAwarenessInfo

```ts
setAwarenessInfo(field: string, value: unknown): void
```

This method set awareness information, for example if you want to inform the metadata of
an user that connected to the room, or to send the pointer information of that user to the
other peers.
