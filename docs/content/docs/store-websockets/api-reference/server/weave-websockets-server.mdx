description: API reference for the WeaveWebsocketsServer class

import { TypeTable } from "fumadocs-ui/components/type-table";

## Overview

The WeaveWebsocketsServer is a server-side class in Weave.js WebSockets store that
provides a real-time backend for collaborative applications using WebSockets as the transport
layer and and Express as the server framework. Built on top of the Yjs ecosystem,
it acts as a store provider that manages the shared-document state and synchronizes
it across all connected clients.

This class enables seamless collaboration by handling server-side:

- Connection management via WebSocket clients
- Document synchronization using CRDTs (through Yjs)
- Broadcasting updates between users in real time
- Support for awareness events
- Support for persistence of the shared-state

## Import

```shell
import { WeaveWebsocketsServer } from "@inditextech/weave-store-websockets/server";
```

## Instantiation

```ts
const websocketsServer = new WeaveWebsocketsServer(params: WeaveWebsocketsServerParams);
```

## Parameters

<TypeTable
  type={{
    performUpgrade: {
      required: true,
      description:
        "A function that receives as parameter the request and must return a boolean indicating if the request allows to perform the HTTP/1.1 protocol upgrade mechanism",
      type: "PerformUpgrade",
    },
    extractRoomId: {
      required: true,
      description:
        "A function that receives as parameter the request and must return the room id to connect to",
      type: "ExtractRoomId",
    },
    persistRoom: {
      description:
        "Weave.js Store to use to handle the real-time communication",
      type: "PersistRoom",
    },
    fetchRoom: {
      description: "Child nodes to render",
      type: "FetchRoom",
    },
    horizontalSyncHandlerConfig: {
      required: false,
      description:
        "The configuration for a Redis instance that syncs horizontally several instances of the server. A must-be when scaling horizontally. If not defined no horizontal sync is performed.",
      type: "WeaveStoreHorizontalSyncConfig",
    },
    initialState: {
      description: "Array of nodes to register and use by the instance",
      type: "initialState",
      default: "defaultInitialState",
    },

}}
/>

<Callout title="In production..." type="warn">
  For production, we recommend deploying using the `horizontalSyncHandlerConfig`
  setup.
</Callout>

## Methods

### handleUpgrade

```ts
handleUpgrade(server: http.Server | https.Server)
```

This method needs the underlying server where request are made and need to apply the
HTTP/1.1 protocol upgrade mechanism to switch from HTTP protocol to the WebSockets one.

## TypeScript types

```ts
type PerformUpgrade = (req: IncomingMessage) => Promise<boolean>;

type ExtractRoomId = (req: IncomingMessage) => string | undefined;

type FetchInitialState = (doc: Y.Doc) => void;

type PersistRoom = (
  roomId: string,
  actualState: Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>
) => Promise<void>;

type FetchRoom = (roomId: string) => Promise<Uint8Array | null>;

type WeaveStoreHorizontalSyncRedisConfig = {
  host: string;
  port: number;
  keyPrefix: string;
  password?: string;
};

type WeaveStoreHorizontalSyncConfig = {
  type: "redis";
  config: WeaveStoreHorizontalSyncRedisConfig;
};

type WeaveWebsocketsServerParams = {
  initialState?: FetchInitialState;
  horizontalSyncHandlerConfig?: WeaveStoreHorizontalSyncConfig;
  performUpgrade: PerformUpgrade;
  extractRoomId: ExtractRoomId;
  persistRoom?: PersistRoom;
  fetchRoom?: FetchRoom;
};
```

## Shared-state initial value

If not defined the `defaultInitialState` is used, which is nothing more than:

<Mermaid
  chart="
flowchart TD;
  Stage --> gridLayer;
  Stage --> mainLayer;
  Stage --> selectionLayer;
  Stage --> usersPointersLayer;
  Stage --> utilityLayer;"
/>

A [Stage](/docs/main/build/nodes/stage) node with 5 children [Layer](/docs/main/build/nodes/layer)
nodes, in the specified order (bottom-to-top):

- **gridLayer**: is the layer used by [WeaveStageGridPlugin](/docs/main/build/plugins/stage-grid)
  to render the reference grid elements.
- **mainLayer**: is the main layer where all the nodes added by the users live.
- **selectionLayer**: is the layer used by [WeaveNodesSelectionPlugin](/docs/main/build/plugins/nodes-selection)
  to render the selection overlay elements.
- **usersPointersLayer**: is the layer used by [WeaveUsersPointersPlugin](/docs/main/build/plugins/users-pointers)
  to render the users pointers overlay elements.
- **utilityLayer**: is a wildcard layer defined that can be used by any plugin.

hat defines the `defaultInitialState` function.
