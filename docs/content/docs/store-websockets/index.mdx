The WebSocket Store is a store for Weave.js that uses the [WebSockets API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)
as the transport layer to enable real-time collaboration over the internet. Built on top of
Yjsâ€™s y-websocket provider, it connects all clients to a central server that manages updates
and syncs shared state almost instantly.

This store includes:

- A class named **WeaveWebsocketsServer** that helps setup the backend on top of an
  [Express](https://expressjs.com/) service.
- A class named **WeaveStoreWebsockets** which is the client used on the frontend side to
  connect to the store backend and provide all the support for the real-time management of the
  shared-state.

## Backend-side usage

Setup the frontend is easy, you just need to follow this steps on your Express-based backend:

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">
 
### Install dependencies

First lets install the necessary dependencies on the backend-side:

```shell
npm install canvas ws y-protocols yjs @inditextech/weave-store-websockets
```

</div>

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">
 
### Server setup

Then setup your server as needed, here you have an example of a simple Express.js server,
where we setup the **WeaveWebsocketsServer** class and the persistence is handled on the file system:

<include lang="ts" meta='title="server.ts"'>
  ../examples/build/stores/websockets-server.ts
</include>

File explanation:

- **`(1)`**: Import the Weave.js server dependencies.
- **`(2)`**: Extract the server when starting it.
- **`(3)`**: Instantiate the `WeaveWebsocketsServer` class. Which returns the WebSockets server.
- **`(4)`**: Define the `performUpgrade` function that returns a boolean if the provided URL
  allows to trigger the HTTP/1.1 protocol upgrade mechanism (upgrades the connection from HTTP to Websocket),
  you receive the request as parameter.
- **`(5)`**: Define the `extractRoomId` function that return the room Id, you receive the request as
  parameter.
- **`(6)`**: Define the `fetchRoom` function that handles the `get` part of the persistence, in this
  case we fetch a binary file with the shared-state from the file system if exists.
- **`(7)`**: Define the `persistRoom` function that handles the `set` part of the persistence, in this
  case we save to a file on the file system the shared-state.
- **`(8)`**: Setup the server that can trigger the HTTP/1.1 protocol upgrade mechanism, in our case is the
  Express server we extracted and started before.

When an user tries to join a room, it calls the defined connection URL with the room Id where he
want to join, then the `WeaveWebsocketsServer` validate that that URL with the `performUpgrade` function,
if valid, it performs the HTTP/1.1 protocol upgrade, then a WebSocket connection is performed. Then the
room Id is extracted using the `extractRoomId` function, and the server uses this information for the rest:
persistence, handling the messages sent over the websockets connections, etc.

## Frontend-side usage

Setup the frontend is easy, you just need to follow this steps:

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">
 
### Install dependencies

First lets install the necessary dependencies for the frontend client:

```shell
npm install @inditextech/weave-store-websockets
```

</div>

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">
 
### Setup the client on the Weave instance

Then you need to add the WebSockets store client to the Weave instance in order to handle
the connection when the user tries to join a room. This is done:

```ts
import { WeaveStoreWebsockets } from "@inditextech/weave-store-websockets/client"; // (1)

const roomId = "MyRoom"; // (2)

const store = new WeaveStoreWebsockets( // (3)
  {
    getUser, // (4)
    undoManagerOptions: {
      captureTimeout: 500,
    }, // (5)
  },
  {
    roomId, // (6)
    wsOptions: {
      serverUrl: "http://localhost:1234" // (7)
    }
  }
);

const instance = new Weave(
  {
    ...
    store, // (8)
  },
  ...
);
```

Explanation:

- **`(1)`**: Import the Weave.js client dependencies.
- **`(2)`**: Define the room Id to connect to.
- **`(3)`**: Instantiate the `WeaveStoreWebsockets` class. Which returns the WebSockets store client.
- **`(4)`**: Define the `getUser` function that return the metadata of the user that wants to connect.
- **`(5)`**: We customize the `captureTimeout` of the Undo-Redo manager of the store, to capture changes every 500ms.
- **`(6)`**: We set the room Id where we want to connect to.
- **`(7)`**: Define server URL where we want to connect on the `serverUrl` parameter.
- **`(8)`**: Set the instantiated store to the Weave instance.
