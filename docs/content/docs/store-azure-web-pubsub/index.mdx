description: Getting started with Weave.js Azure Web PubSub store API
---

The Azure Web PubSub Store is a store for Weave.js that uses the [Azure Web PubSub](https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/products/web-pubsub)
cloud infrastructure as the transport layer to enable real-time collaboration over the internet.

This store includes:

- A class named **WeaveAzureWebPubsubServer** that helps setup the backend on top of an
  [Express](https://expressjs.com/) service.
- A class named **WeaveStoreAzureWebPubsub** which is the client used on the frontend side to
  connect to the store backend and provide all the support for the real-time management of the
  shared-state.

## Backend-side usage

Setup the frontend is easy, you just need to follow this steps on your Express-based backend:

### Install the WebSocket Store backend dependencies

First lets install the necessary dependencies on the backend-side:

```shell
npm install canvas @azure/web-pubsub @azure/web-pubsub-express y-protocols yjs @inditextech/weave-store-azure-web-pubsub
```

</div>

### Setup the server

Then setup your server as needed, here you have an example of a simple server, where the persistence
is handled on the file system:

<include lang="ts" meta='title="server.ts"'>
  ../examples/build/stores/azure-web-pubsub-server.ts
</include>

File explanation:

- **`(1)`**: Import the Weave.js server dependencies.
- **`(2)`**: Define the endpoint, key and hubName of the Azure Web PubSub instance where we will connect.
- **`(3)`**: Instantiate the `WeaveAzureWebPubsubServer` class. Which returns the server utilities to handle
  Azure Web PubSub connections.
- **`(4)`**: Define the Azure Web Pubsub properties.
- **`(5)`**: Define the `fetchRoom` function that handles the `get` part of the persistence, in this
  case we fetch a binary file with the shared-state from the file system if exists.
- **`(6)`**: Define the `persistRoom` function that handles the `set` part of the persistence, in this
  case we save to a file on the file system the shared-state.
- **`(7)`**: Setup the middleware that handles the Azure Web PubSub connections.
- **`(8)`**: Setup a route that is responsible to call the `clientConnect` method of the server in order to
  obtain a secure connection URL to the Azure Web PubSub Hub.
- **`(9)`**: Setup the server routes.
- **`(10)`**: Start the server.

When an user tries to join a room, it calls the defined route with the room Id where he
want to join, then the `WeaveAzureWebPubsubServer` using the `clientConnect` function, call the Azure Web PubSub
Hub to extract a secure connection and this URL is passed as response to the client. Then the client connects to
this URL and the server does the rest: persistence, handling the messages sent over the connection, etc.

### Install the WebSocket Store frontend dependency

First lets install the necessary dependencies for the frontend client:

```shell
npm install @inditextech/weave-store-azure-web-pubsub
```

</div>

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">
 
### Setup the client on the Weave instance

Then you need to add the Azure Web PubSub store client to the Weave instance in order to handle
the connection when the user tries to join a room. This is done:

```ts
import { WeaveStoreAzureWebPubsub } from "@inditextech/weave-store-azure-web-pubsub/client"; // (1)

const roomId = "MyRoom"; // (2)

const store = new WeaveStoreAzureWebPubsub( // (3)
  {
    getUser, // (4)
    undoManagerOptions: {
      captureTimeout: 500,
    }, // (5)
  },
  {
    roomId, // (6)
    url: http://localhost:1234/api/v1/rooms/${roomId}/connect`, // (7)
  }
);

const instance = new Weave(
  {
    ...
    store, // (8)
  },
  ...
);
```

Explanation:

- **`(1)`**: Import the Weave.js client dependencies.
- **`(2)`**: Define the room Id to connect to.
- **`(3)`**: Instantiate the `WeaveStoreAzureWebPubsub` class. Which returns the Azure Web PubSub store client.
- **`(4)`**: Define the `getUser` function that return the metadata of the user that wants to connect.
- **`(5)`**: We customize the `captureTimeout` of the Undo-Redo manager of the store, to capture changes every 500ms.
- **`(6)`**: We set the room Id where we want to connect to.
- **`(7)`**: Define url where we want to connect and fetch the connection URL to the Azure Web PubSub.
- **`(8)`**: Set the instantiated store to the Weave instance.
