import { TypeTable } from "fumadocs-ui/components/type-table";

## Overview

The WeaveStoreAzureWebPubsub class is a client-side store in the Weave.js Azure Web PubSub store
that enables real-time collaboration via Azure Web PubSub. It connects to a backend powered by
[WeaveAzureWebPubsubServer](/docs/store-azure-web-pubsub), using Yjs under the hood to handle
conflict-free data syncing and user awareness.

This store allows your Weave.js-based frontend application to join a collaborative session, share
state with other users, and reflect live updates instantly—all while leveraging the scalability and
reliability of Azure’s managed infrastructure.

## Import

```shell
import { WeaveStoreAzureWebPubsub } from "@inditextech/weave-store-azure-web-pubsub/client";
```

## Instantiation

```ts
const store = new WeaveStoreAzureWebPubsub(storeData: Uint8Array | null, storeOptions: WeaveStoreOptions, azureWebPubsubOptions: WeaveStoreAzureWebPubsubOptions);
```

## TypeScript types

```ts
type WeaveStoreWebsocketsConnectionStatusKeys =
  keyof typeof WEAVE_STORE_WEBSOCKETS_CONNECTION_STATUS;
type WeaveStoreWebsocketsConnectionStatus =
  (typeof WEAVE_STORE_WEBSOCKETS_CONNECTION_STATUS)[WeaveStoreWebsocketsConnectionStatusKeys];

type WeaveStoreWebsocketsCallbacks = {
  onConnectionStatusChange?: (
    status: WeaveStoreWebsocketsConnectionStatus
  ) => void;
};

type WeaveUser = {
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

type WeaveUndoManagerOptions = {
  captureTimeout?: number;
  trackedOrigins?: Set<any>;
};

type WeaveStoreOptions = {
  getUser: () => WeaveUser;
  undoManagerOptions?: WeaveUndoManagerOptions;
};

type WeaveStoreWebsocketsOptions = {
  roomId: string;
  wsOptions: {
    serverUrl: string;
  };
  callbacks?: WeaveStoreWebsocketsCallbacks;
};
```

## Events

### onStateChange

```ts
onStateChange: WeaveStoreOnStateChangeEvent;

```ts
onUndoManagerStatusChange: WeaveStoreOnUndoRedoChangeEvent;
```

The `onUndoManagerStatusChange` event is called when the undo/redo manager changes.

### onNodeChange

```ts
