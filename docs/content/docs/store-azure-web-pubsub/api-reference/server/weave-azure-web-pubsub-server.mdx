description: API reference for the WeaveAzureWebPubsubServer class

import { TypeTable } from "fumadocs-ui/components/type-table";

## Overview

The WeaveAzureWebPubsubServer is a server-side class in the Weave.js Azure Web PubSub store
that enables real-time collaboration using Azure Web PubSub as the transport layer. It serves
as a store provider, handling the synchronization of shared document state across all clients
connected to a specific room.

Built on top of Yjs, this class leverages Azure's managed Web PubSub infrastructure to offer scalable,
low-latency communication, with support for CRDT-based document syncing, user presence (awareness),
and optional persistence of shared state.

This class enables seamless collaboration by handling server-side:

- Connection management via WebSocket clients
- Document synchronization using CRDTs (through Yjs)
- Broadcasting updates between users in real time
- Support for awareness events
- Support for persistence of the shared-state

## Import

```shell
import { WeaveAzureWebPubsubServer } from "@inditextech/weave-store-azure-web-pubsub/server";
```

## Instantiation

```ts
const azureWebPubSubServer = new WeaveAzureWebPubsubServer(params: WeaveAzureWebPubsubServerParams);
```

## Parameters

<TypeTable
  type={{
    pubsubConfig: {
      required: true,
      description:
        "An object defining the Azure Web PubSub params: endpoint, custom auth (token flow or key) and hub name. By default we promote the use of DefaultAzureCredential from the @azure/identity dependency.",
      type: "WeaveAzureWebPubsubConfig",
    },
    eventsHandlerConfig: {
      required: true,
      description: "An object Azure Web PubSub Event Handler configuration",
      type: "WebPubSubEventHandlerOptions",

      type: "PersistRoom",
    },
    fetchRoom: {
      description: "Child nodes to render",
      type: "FetchRoom",
    },
    initialState: {

      type: "initialState",

    },
  }}
/>

## Methods

### getMiddleware

```ts
getMiddleware();
```

This method return the necessary middlewares that you need to attach to your Express
server in order to manage the Azure Web PubSub connectivity.

### clientConnect

```ts
clientConnect(roomId: string): Promise<string>
```

This method return a secure connection URL to use client-side to connect to the Azure
Web PubSub infrastructure.

Used

## TypeScript types

```ts
type PerformUpgrade = (req: IncomingMessage) => Promise<boolean>;

type ExtractRoomId = (req: IncomingMessage) => string | undefined;

type FetchInitialState = (doc: Y.Doc) => void;

type PersistRoom = (
  roomId: string,
  actualState: Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>
) => Promise<void>;

type FetchRoom = (roomId: string) => Promise<Uint8Array | null>;

type WeaveStoreAzureWebPubsubConfig = {
  endpoint: string;
  auth?: {
    key?: string;
    custom?: TokenCredential;
  };
  hubName: string;
};

type WeaveAzureWebPubsubServerParams = {
  initialState?: FetchInitialState;
  pubSubConfig: WeaveAzureWebPubsubConfig;
  persistRoom?: PersistRoom;
  fetchRoom?: FetchRoom;
};

interface WebPubSubEventHandlerOptions {
  /**
   * Custom serving path for the path of the CloudEvents handler.
   */
  path?: string;

  /**
   * Handle 'connect' event, the service waits for the response to proceed.
   */
  handleConnect?: (
    connectRequest: ConnectRequest,
    connectResponse: ConnectResponseHandler
  ) => void;

  /**
   * Handle user events, the service waits for the response to proceed.
   */
  handleUserEvent?: (
    userEventRequest: UserEventRequest,
    userEventResponse: UserEventResponseHandler
  ) => void;

  /**
   * Event trigger for "connected" unblocking event. This is an unblocking event and the service does not wait for the response.
   */
  onConnected?: (connectedRequest: ConnectedRequest) => void;

  /**
   *
   * Event triggers for "disconnected" unblocking event. This is an unblocking event and the service does not wait for the response.
   */
  onDisconnected?: (disconnectedRequest: DisconnectedRequest) => void;

  /**
   * If not specified, by default allow all the endpoints, otherwise only allow specified endpoints
   */
  allowedEndpoints?: string[];
}
```

## Shared-state initial value

If not defined the `defaultInitialState` is used, which is nothing more than:

<Mermaid
  chart="
flowchart TD;
  Stage --> gridLayer;
  Stage --> mainLayer;
  Stage --> selectionLayer;
  Stage --> usersPointersLayer;
  Stage --> utilityLayer;"
/>

A [Stage](/docs/main/build/nodes/stage) node with 5 children [Layer](/docs/main/build/nodes/layer)
nodes, in the specified order (bottom-to-top):

- **gridLayer**: is the layer used by [WeaveStageGridPlugin](/docs/main/build/plugins/stage-grid)
  to render the reference grid elements.
- **mainLayer**: is the main layer where all the nodes added by the users live.
- **selectionLayer**: is the layer used by [WeaveNodesSelectionPlugin](/docs/main/build/plugins/nodes-selection)
  to render the selection overlay elements.
- **usersPointersLayer**: is the layer used by [WeaveUsersPointersPlugin](/docs/main/build/plugins/users-pointers)
  to render the users pointers overlay elements.
- **utilityLayer**: is a wildcard layer defined that can be used by any plugin.

Check out here the [code](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/store-azure-web-pubsub/src/server/default-initial-state.ts)
hat defines the `defaultInitialState` function.
