description: Blueprint for the Plugin API

## Overview

The abstract [WeavePlugin](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/plugins/plugin.ts)
class represents the base structure for all plugins in the Weave.js ecosystem. Plugins are modular components that
extend the functionality of the canvas environment without modifying the core Weave.js system itself.

The WeavePlugin class provides the foundational API that all specific plugins—such as selection tools, grid rendering,
snapping systems, or user pointers—inherit and build upon. It defines the lifecycle hooks and integration points necessary
to inject custom behavior into a Weave.js app.

Plugins are ideal for:

- Building reusable visual or behavioral extensions for the canvas.
- Enabling domain-specific tools (e.g., diagramming tools, design tool overlays).
- Keeping the core system clean and lightweight, while scaling with feature complexity.
- Supporting collaborative behaviors (e.g., multi-user cursors, collaborative selection).

All plugins must extend this class.

## Lifecycle

A Weave.js plugin lifecycle is pretty simple:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
stateDiagram-v2
  A: Weave instance is started
  B: Plugins are registered
  C: getName() is called on each plugin
  D: Rendering cycle begins
  E: First render completed
  F: init() is called on each plugin
  G: Subsequent renders
  H: render() is called on each plugin
  [*] --> A
  A --> B
  state B {
    C --> [*]
  }
  B --> D
  state D {
    E --> F
    F --> G
  }
  state G {
    H --> [*]
  }
  G --> G
  D --> [*]`}
/>

<Callout title="Decoupled from the lifecycle">

The following methods are called outside the lifecycle:

- When an user wants to disable the plugin, the `disable` method is called.
- When an user wants to enable the plugin, the `enable` method is called.

</Callout>

## Import

```shell
import { WeavePlugin } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

## Name

All plugins must define a property:

```ts
name: string;
```

Which defines the plugin identity, for example the plugin that handles the stage grid it's `name` is
`stageGrid`. The `name` must be unique among other plugins.

## Methods

### getName

```ts
getName(): string
```

This method returns the `name` property of the node.

### isEnabled

```ts
isEnabled(): boolean
```

This method returns `true` if the plugin is enabled, `false` otherwise.

## Abstract Methods

### init

```ts
init?(): void
```

This method initializes the plugin, ideal to initialize all necessary Konva elements needed
and their events.

### render

```ts
render?(): void
```

This method is called then the canvas re-renders, useful to update the plugin nodes updated
according to the changes made by the user.

### enable

```ts
enable(): void
```

This method makes enabled the plugin.

### disable

```ts
disable(): void
```

This method disables the plugin.
