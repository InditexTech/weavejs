## Introduction

Plugins are the modular pieces that extend and enhance the functionality of Weave.js.
They allow you to add behavior to the canvas: like selection, zooming, snapping, panning,
keyboard shortcuts, and more, without modifying the core system.

Plugins are designed to be lightweight, composable, and easy to integrate, making it simple
to build rich, interactive experiences. Whether you're enabling multi-selection, managing
drag-and-drop, or integrating custom logic, Plugins are how you supercharge your canvas with
reusable, context-aware features.

Weave.js includes a set of built-in plugins, but you can also create your own to tailor
functionality to your specific application needs.
