Weave.js is a modular library that streamlines the **development of visual
collaborative web applications** built on-top of an HTML5 canvas, designed with a
robust architecture, **Weave.js** enables developers to extend functionality
seamlessly.

Weave.js offers a clean and efficient API for:

<Cards>

<Card icon={<CpuIcon className="text-purple-300" />} title='Weave.js SDK'>

Handles most of the logic, includes the base nodes, plugins and actions.

</Card>

<Card icon={<Database className="text-blue-300" />} title='Weave.js Store'>

Handles the backend & frontend (client) logic to support real-time collaboration
on top different transports.

</Cards>

Ideal for building applications such as whiteboards, diagram editors and design
platforms, Weave.js provides the flexibility and scalability needed for modern,
canvas-based collaborative tools.
