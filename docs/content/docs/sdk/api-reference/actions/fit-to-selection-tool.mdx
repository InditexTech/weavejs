## Overview

The [WeaveFitToSelectionToolAction](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/actions/fit-to-selection-tool/fit-to-selection-tool.ts)
class that automatically zooms and pans the canvas to fit the currently selected nodes within
the visible viewport. It helps users focus on specific elements of their work quickly, especially
in large or complex canvases.

This action is the “fit to selection” counterpart of the broader WeaveFitToScreenToolAction, offering
precise control and workflow efficiency.

The class extends the [WeaveAction](/docs/sdk/api-reference/actions/action) class.
