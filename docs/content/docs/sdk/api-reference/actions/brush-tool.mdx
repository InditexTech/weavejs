description: Paint freeform strokes on the canvas
---

## Overview

The [WeaveBrushToolAction](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/actions/brush-tool/brush-tool.ts)
class that enables users to draw freeform strokes on the canvas using a brush tool. It lets users click and drag across the canvas
to create a smooth, continuous pathâ€”perfect for sketching, annotating, or freehand drawing within a collaborative environment.

Each stroke is recorded as a [WeaveLineNode](/docs/api-reference/nodes/line), synchronized across all connected users in real time.

The class extends the [WeaveAction](/docs/sdk/api-reference/actions/action) class.
