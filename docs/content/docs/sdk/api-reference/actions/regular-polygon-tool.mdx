## Overview

The [WeaveRegularPolygonToolAction](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/actions/regular-polygon-tool/regular-polygon-tool.ts)
class that allows users to create regular polygons shapes on the canvas by clicking
and dragging. It provides a smooth, intuitive way to add structured, resizable
star elements .

added to the shared state and synchronized across all users.

The class extends the [WeaveAction](/docs/sdk/api-reference/actions/action) class.
