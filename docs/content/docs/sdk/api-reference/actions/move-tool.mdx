description: Activate the panning or movement of the canvas

import { TypeTable } from "fumadocs-ui/components/type-table";

## Overview

The [WeaveMoveToolAction](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/actions/move-tool/move-tool.ts)
class that enables users to pan (move) the entire canvas by dragging the background.
It is specifically designed to allow easy navigation across large or zoomed-in canvases
without altering the position of nodes or layers.

This tool acts as a navigation aid, switching the canvas into a mode where dragging
translates the viewport rather than interacting with individual elements.

The class extends the [WeaveAction](/docs/sdk/api-reference/actions/action) class.
