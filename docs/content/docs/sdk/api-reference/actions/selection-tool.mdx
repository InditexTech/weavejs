import { TypeTable } from "fumadocs-ui/components/type-table";

## Overview

The [WeaveSelectionToolAction](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/actions/selection-tool/selection-tool.ts)
class that allows users to enter or exit selection mode. While it does not handle
the selection logic itself, it activates the selection behavior managed by the
[WeaveNodesSelectionPlugin](/docs/sdk/api-reference/plugins/nodes-selection),
enabling users to click or drag to select nodes on the canvas.

This tool acts as a toggle for interaction context, letting users switch between
selection and other editing tools (e.g., draw, pan, or create).

The class extends the [WeaveAction](/docs/sdk/api-reference/actions/action) class.
