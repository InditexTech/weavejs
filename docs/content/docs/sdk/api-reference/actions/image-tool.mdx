import { TypeTable } from "fumadocs-ui/components/type-table";

## Overview

The [WeaveImageToolAction](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/actions/image-tool/image-tool.ts)
class that enables users to insert image nodes into the canvas. It provides
an intuitive way to add visual content—either by selecting an image file, dragging
and dropping, or integrating with an image picker—allowing users to enhance their
collaborative workspace with rich media.

Each interaction results in the creation of a [WeaveImageNode](/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/image),
which can be resized, moved, and synchronized across all connected users.

The class extends the [WeaveAction](/docs/sdk/api-reference/actions/action) class.

## Name

This action `name` property value is `imageTool`.

## Import

```shell
import { WeaveImageToolAction } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

## Instantiation

new WeaveImageToolAction();
```

## TypeScript types

```ts
type WeaveImageToolActionOnStartLoadImageEvent = undefined;
type WeaveImageToolActionOnEndLoadImageEvent = Error | undefined;

type WeaveImageToolActionTriggerParams = {
  imageURL?: string;
};

type WeaveImageToolActionTriggerReturn =
  | {
      finishUploadCallback: (imageURL: string) => void;
    }
  | undefined;
```

## Trigger function params

```ts
trigger(cancelAction: () => void, params?: WeaveImageToolActionTriggerParams): void;
```

For `WeaveImageToolActionTriggerParams`:

<TypeTable
  type={{
    ["imageURL"]: {
      description:
        "The URL of the image, if already uploaded to an external service. URL must the same as the application URL to avoid cross-origin issues. We recommend to proxy the images through the application.",
      type: "string",
    },
  }}
/>

## Events

### onImageLoadStart

```ts
onImageLoadStart: WeaveNodesSelectionPluginOnNodesChangeEvent;
```

The `onImageLoadStart` event is called when the image is stated to load onto the canvas.

### onImageLoadEnd

```ts
onImageLoadEnd: WeaveNodesSelectionPluginOnNodesChangeEvent;
```

The `onImageLoadEnd` event is called when the image ended loading into the canvas.
