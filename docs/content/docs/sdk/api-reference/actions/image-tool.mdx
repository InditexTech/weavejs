title: WeaveImageToolAction
description: Add an image to the canvas
---

import { TypeTable } from "fumadocs-ui/components/type-table";

## Overview

The [WeaveImageToolAction](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/actions/image-tool/image-tool.ts)
class that enables users to insert image nodes into the canvas. It provides
an intuitive way to add visual content—either by selecting an image file, dragging
and dropping, or integrating with an image picker—allowing users to enhance their
collaborative workspace with rich media.

Each interaction results in the creation of a [WeaveImageNode](/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/image),
which can be resized, moved, and synchronized across all connected users.

The class extends the [WeaveAction](/docs/sdk/api-reference/actions/action) class.
