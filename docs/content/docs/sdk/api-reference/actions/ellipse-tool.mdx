## Overview

The [WeaveEllipseToolAction](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/actions/ellipse-tool/ellipse-tool.ts)
class that allows users to create ellipse shapes on the canvas by clicking
and dragging. It provides a smooth, intuitive way to add structured, resizable
rectangular elements that can serve as building blocks for diagrams, layouts,
mockups, and more.

Each interaction results in the creation of a [WeaveEllipseNode](/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/ellipse),
added to the shared state and synchronized across all users.

The class extends the [WeaveAction](/docs/sdk/api-reference/actions/action) class.
