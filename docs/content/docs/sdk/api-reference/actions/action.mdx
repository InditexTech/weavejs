## Overview

The abstract [WeaveAction](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/actions/action.ts)
class represents represents a user-driven operation or system-triggered change within the canvas. Actions provide a
structured and trackable way to mutate the shared state, ensuring that all modifications are intentional, synchronized,
and potentially reversible.

Every meaningful change in a Weave.js application — such as creating a node, moving an element, zooming the stage, or
grouping nodes — is typically triggered through an Action.

WeaveAction class uses internally a [Proxy](), that allows us to intercept operations of the class, for example
when the properties changes, and redefine that operation. This enable a developer to change Action parameters when
triggered allowing to give the end-user more control over the action.

Plugins are ideal for:

- Maintaining a consistent and scalable workflow for all user interactions.
- Enabling real-time, collaborative state mutations that stay predictable and traceable.

All actions must extend this class.

## Lifecycle

Weave.js action lifecycle is pretty simple:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
stateDiagram-v2
  A: Weave instance is started
  B: Actions are registered
  C: getName() is called on each action
  D: Rendering cycle begins
  E: First render
  F: init() is called on each action
  [*] --> A
  A --> B
  state B {
    C --> [*]
  }
  B --> D
  state D {
    E --> F
    F --> [*]
  }
  D --> [*]`}
/>

<Callout title="Decoupled from the lifecycle">

The following methods are called outside the lifecycle:

- When an user want to trigger an action, the `trigger` function is called.
- When the action finishes or the user cancel the action, the `cleanup` function is called.

</Callout>

## Import

```shell
import { WeaveAction } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

## Name

All actions must define a property:

```ts
name: string;
```

Which defines the action identity, for example the action that allow users to draw free-lines
it's `name` is `brushTool`. The `name` must be unique among other actions.

## Instantiation

```ts
new WeaveAction(callbacks: WeaveActionCallbacks)
```

A WeaveAction receives as parameter the type `WeaveActionCallbacks`.

## TypeScript types

```ts
type WeaveElementAttributes = {
  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
  [key: string]: any;
  id?: string;
  nodeType?: string;
  children?: WeaveStateElement[];
};

type WeaveStateElement = {
  key: string;
  type: string;
  props: WeaveElementAttributes;
};

type WeaveActionPropsChangeCallback = (props: WeaveElementAttributes) => void;

type WeaveActionCallbacks = {
  onPropsChange?: WeaveActionPropsChangeCallback;
};
```

## Parameters

For `WeaveActionCallbacks`:

<TypeTable
  type={{
    ["onPropsChange"]: {
      description: "A callback that is called when action properties changed.",
      type: "WeaveActionPropsChangeCallback",
    },
  }}
/>

## Methods

### getName

```ts
getName(): string
```

This method returns the `name` property of the node.

### updateProps

```ts
updateProps(props: WeaveElementAttributes): void
```

This method update the props of the action allowing to customize internals while the
action is triggered.

### getProps

```ts
getProps(): WeaveElementAttributes
```

This method return the action props, normally propagating from the underlying main node.

## Abstract Methods

### init

```ts
init?(): void
```

This method initializes the action, ideal to initialize all necessary Konva elements needed
and their events.

### trigger

```ts
trigger(cancelAction: () => void, params?: unknown): unknown;
```

This method triggers the action, as parameters receives:

- **cancelAction**: a callback that allows to cancel the action.
- **params**: are the params provided by the user when the action is triggered.

### internalUpdate

```ts
internalUpdate?(): void
```

This method, if defined is called when a property of the class is changed (via set).

### cleanup

```ts
cleanup?(): void
```

This method is called when the action finishes or is cancelled, allowing developers to
cleanup events o reseting the action internals for next uses.
