## Overview

The [WeaveVideoToolAction](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/actions/video-tool/video-tool.ts)
class that enables users to insert video nodes into the canvas. It provides
an intuitive way to add visual content—either by selecting a video file, dragging
and dropping, or integrating with an video picker—allowing users to enhance their
collaborative workspace with rich media.

Each interaction results in the creation of a [WeaveVideoNode](/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/video),
which can be resized, moved, and synchronized across all connected users.

The class extends the [WeaveAction](/docs/sdk/api-reference/actions/action) class.
