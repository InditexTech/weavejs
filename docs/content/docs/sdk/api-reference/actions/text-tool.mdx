## Overview

The [WeaveTextToolAction](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/actions/text-tool/text-tool.ts)
class that allows users to insert text nodes onto the canvas by clicking. It
provides a fast and intuitive way to add labels, notes, annotations, or any textual
content within a collaborative visual environment.

Each interaction results in the creation of a [WeaveTextNode](/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/text),
ready for direct editing and synchronized in real time with all connected users.

The class extends the [WeaveAction](/docs/sdk/api-reference/actions/action) class.
