## Overview

The [WeaveFitToScreenToolAction](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/actions/fit-to-screen-tool/fit-to-screen-tool.ts)
class that automatically adjusts the canvas viewport so that all visible content (nodes) is centered
and scaled to fit within the current view. It provides users with a convenient way to reorient the canvas,

The class extends the [WeaveAction](/docs/sdk/api-reference/actions/action) class.
