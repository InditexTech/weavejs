## Overview

The [WeavePenToolAction](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/actions/pen-tool/pen-tool.ts)
class that allows users to draw precise, vector-based paths by clicking to place
points and optionally closing or smoothing the resulting shape. Unlike the brush
tool (which captures freehand strokes), the pen tool emphasizes structured line
creation, making it ideal for diagrams, connectors, wireframes, and flow-based
interactions.

Each completed path becomes a [WeaveLineNode](/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/line),
synced in real time across all collaborators.

The class extends the [WeaveAction](/docs/sdk/api-reference/actions/action) class.
