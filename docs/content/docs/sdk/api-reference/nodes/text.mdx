## Overview

The [WeaveTextNode](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/nodes/text/text.ts)
class represents a text element on the Weave.js canvas. It allows users to add editable or static text directly
into the collaborative visual environment, making it essential for labels, annotations, titles, and descriptive
content.

Built on top of Konvaâ€™s [Text](https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.Text.html) class shape under the hood, the WeaveTextNode
provides rich text customization, interaction handling, and real-time synchronization, ensuring that text content stays up-to-date across all connected users.

Text are ideal for:

- Adding titles, labels, and descriptions to diagrams or whiteboards.
- Allowing users to comment or annotate visually inside collaborative spaces.
- Enabling rich-text editing workflows inside a canvas tool.

The class extends the [WeaveNode](/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/node) class
