## Overview

The [WeaveLayerNode](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/nodes/layer/layer.ts)
class represents a logical and visual container within the Weave.js canvas, built directly on top of Konvaâ€™s
[Layer](https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.Layer.html) class. It serves as an organizational unit for grouping nodes
together, improving rendering performance, and structuring complex scenes in a manageable way.

Layers are useful for:

- Improving performance by isolating redraws, only the layers with changes are re-rendered, minimizing canvas work.
- Helps managing the visual stacking order also known as z-index (in terms of layers).
- Specific layers can be used by plugins, for example, a grid plugin uses a grid layer to render the grid isolated
  from the main layer where the user add the nodes of their application.

<Callout title="Amount of layers" type="warn">
  As specified on [Konva.js
  documentation](https://konvajs.org/docs/performance/Layer_Management.html), in
  terms of performance, we should take into account the amount of layers we
  create (this mainly because each layer is a separate instance of a canvas),
  the maximum amount of layers shouldn't exceed 5.
</Callout>

The class extends the [WeaveNode](/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/node) class

## Type

This node `nodeType` property value is `layer`.

## Import

```shell
import { WeaveLayerNode } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

## Instantiation

<Callout title="Don't directly use">
  We don't recommend to use this node directly. To define the application Stage,
  use the stores `initialState` configuration property on server-side.
</Callout>

```ts
new WeaveLayerNode();
```
