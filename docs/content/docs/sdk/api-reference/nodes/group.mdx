## Overview

The [WeaveGroupNode](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/nodes/group/group.ts)
class represents a container node in Weave.js that groups multiple child nodes together into a single, manageable entity.
Built on top of Konva’s [Group](https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.Group.html) class, it allows developers and users to
treat a collection of nodes as a single object—moving, scaling, rotating, or interacting with them as one.

Groups are useful for:

- Organizing multiple child nodes under one parent, allowing bulk transformations like dragging, resizing, scaling,
  and rotating.
- Ensures that transformations applied to the group (like moving or rotating) cascade properly to the children,
  maintaining relative positions and sizes.
- Allows nesting other groups or individual nodes, making it flexible for complex scene structures (e.g., a diagram
  block containing text, shapes, and connectors).

The class extends the [WeaveNode](/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/node) class
