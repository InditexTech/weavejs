## Overview

The [WeaveRectangleNode](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/nodes/rectangle/rectangle.ts)
class represents a basic rectangular shape within the Weave.js canvas. It is one of the fundamental visual building blocks for
creating collaborative tools, diagrams, design layouts, and interactive content.

Built on top of Konvaâ€™s [Rect](https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.Rect.html) class shape under the hood, the WeaveRectangleNode
offers a simple yet powerful primitive that supports full interaction, styling, and real-time synchronization.

Rectangles are ideal for:

- Building interactive visual elements (e.g., cards, sections, containers).
- Forming basic layout structures for more complex visual tools.
- Acting as a foundational primitive in diagrams, whiteboards, or flow-based applications.

The class extends the [WeaveNode](/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/node) class
