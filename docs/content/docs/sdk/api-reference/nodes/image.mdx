## Overview

The [WeaveImageNode](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/nodes/image/image.ts)
class represents an image element on the Weave.js collaborative canvas. It allows users to upload, display, and
manipulate images within a real-time shared environment, making it a key building block for visual storytelling,
design workspaces, and multimedia collaboration.

Built on top of Konvaâ€™s [Image](https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.Image.html) class shape under the hood, the WeaveImageNode
handles image loading (via callbacks), scaling, positioning, and real-time synchronization, ensuring a smooth
collaborative experience even when working with dynamic media content.

Images are ideal for:

- Allowing users to import visual references, mockups, icons, or photos into a collaborative canvas.
- Building rich multimedia design spaces or creative whiteboards.
- Enhancing collaborative diagrams with visual context and assets.

The class extends the [WeaveNode](/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/node) class
