## Overview

The [WeaveImageNode](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/nodes/image/image.ts)
class represents an image element on the Weave.js collaborative canvas. It allows users to upload, display, and
manipulate images within a real-time shared environment, making it a key building block for visual storytelling,
design workspaces, and multimedia collaboration.

Built on top of Konva’s [Image](https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.Image.html) class shape under the hood, the WeaveImageNode
handles image loading (via callbacks), scaling, positioning, and real-time synchronization, ensuring a smooth
collaborative experience even when working with dynamic media content.

Images are ideal for:

- Allowing users to import visual references, mockups, icons, or photos into a collaborative canvas.
- Building rich multimedia design spaces or creative whiteboards.
- Enhancing collaborative diagrams with visual context and assets.

The class extends the [WeaveNode](/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/node) class

## Type

This node `nodeType` property value is `image`.

## Import

```shell
import { WeaveImageNode } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

## Instantiation

```ts
new WeaveImageNode(params?: WeaveImageNodeParams);
```

## TypeScript types

```ts
type WeaveNodeTransformerProperties = Konva.TransformerConfig;

type ImageCrossOrigin = "anonymous" | "use-credentials";

type WeaveImageProperties = {
  performance: {
    caching: boolean;
  };
  crossOrigin: ImageCrossOrigin;
  transform?: WeaveNodeTransformerProperties;
  urlTransformer?: URLTransformerFunction;
  onDblClick?: (instance: WeaveImageNode, node: Konva.Group) => void;
};

type WeaveImageNodeParams = {
  config: DeepPartial<WeaveImageProperties>;
};

type WeaveImageCropEndTypeKeys = keyof typeof WEAVE_IMAGE_CROP_END_TYPE;
type WeaveImageCropEndType =
  (typeof WEAVE_IMAGE_CROP_END_TYPE)[WeaveImageCropEndTypeKeys];

type WeaveImageOnCropStartEvent = {
  instance: Konva.Group;
};

type WeaveImageOnCropEndEvent = {
  instance: Konva.Group;
};
```

## Parameters

For `WeaveImageNodeParams`:

<TypeTable
  type={{
    ["config"]: {
      required: true,
      description: "Config parameters for the node.",
      type: "Partial<WeaveImageProperties>",
    },
  }}
/>

For `WeaveImageProperties`:

<TypeTable
  type={{
    ["performance.caching"]: {
      description:
        "Boolean that enables image nodes caching, increasing the performance of the canvas.",
      type: "boolean",
      default: "false",
    },
    ["crossOrigin"]: {
      description:
        "Value of the property crossOrigin for the HTMLImageElement DOM element. Useful for CORS support.",
      type: "ImageCrossOrigin",
      default: "anonymous",
    },
    ["transform"]: {
      description:
        "Setup the transform properties for the image (if can be resized, rotated, anchors, etc.).",
      type: "object",
    },
    ["urlTransformer"]: {
      description:
        "Function that receives the actual image node URL, and returns an URL. Useful for transformations of the URL.",
      type: "(url: string) => string",
    },
    ["onDblClick"]: {
      description:
        "Setup an callback that is called when an user double-click (or double tap) on the node",
      type: "(instance: WeaveImageNode, node: Konva.Group) => void",
    },
  }}
/>

## Default values

```ts
const WEAVE_IMAGE_NODE_TYPE = "image";

const WEAVE_IMAGE_CROP_END_TYPE = {
  ["ACCEPT"]: "accept",
  ["CANCEL"]: "cancel",
};

const WEAVE_IMAGE_DEFAULT_CONFIG: WeaveImageProperties = {
  performance: {
    caching: false,
  },
  crossOrigin: "anonymous",
};
```

## Methods

### triggerCrop

```ts
triggerCrop(imageNode: Konva.Group): void
```

Function that when is called triggers the image cropping on the specified node.

### closeCrop

```ts
closeCrop(imageNode: Konva.Group, type: WeaveImageCropEndType): void
```

Function that when is called closes (accepted or canceled) the image cropping.

### resetCrop

```ts
resetCrop(imageNode: Konva.Group): void
```

Function that when is called reset the image cropping to its original size.

## Konva.Node Augmentation

This Node extends the `Konva.Node` class to define several functions:

---

### triggerCrop

```ts
triggerCrop(): void
```

Function that when is called triggers the image cropping.

---

### dblClick

```ts
dblClick(): void
```

Function that when double click (or tap) is triggered triggers the image cropping.

---

### closeCrop

```ts
closeCrop(type: WeaveImageCropEndType): void
```

Function that when is called closes the image cropping, depending on the `type`:

- `accept`: accepts the cropping configuration and crops the image.
- `cancel`: cancel the cropping configuration without changes to the image.

---

### resetCrop

```ts
resetCrop(): void
```

Function that when is called resets the cropping properties of an image.

## Events

### onImageCropStart

```ts
onImageCropStart: WeaveImageOnCropStartEvent;
```

The `onImageCropStart` event is called when an image enters on the cropping edition mode.

---

### onImageCropEnd

```ts
onImageCropEnd: WeaveImageOnCropEndEvent;
```

The `onImageCropEnd` event is called when an image closes the cropping edition mode.
