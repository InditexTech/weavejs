## Introduction

Nodes are the core visual elements in Weave.js, they represent everything you see and
interact with on the canvas. From simple shapes like rectangles and lines, to text, images,
and complex containers like frames, Nodes are the building blocks of your collaborative
interface.

Each Node is based on Konva.js primitives and enhanced with interactive behavior, styling,
and real-time sync capabilities. Nodes can be selected, moved, edited, grouped, and extended,
making them flexible enough to power everything from diagram tools to whiteboards and custom UIs.

In short, if it shows up on the canvas in Weave.js, it's probably a Node.

## Available nodes

Weave.js team maintain a set of **base nodes**, think of them as the minimal nodes to
build visual collaborative applications. This are the nodes:

### Base

<Cards>

<Card href="/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/node" title='WeaveNode'>

The WeaveNode node is the abstract class that defines the blueprint of a node in Weave.js.

</Card>

</Cards>

### Structure

<Cards>

<Card href="/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/layer" title='WeaveLayerNode'>

The WeaveLayerNode node is a logical container within the Stage. It allows you to separate visual
elements, for example: background grids, interactive elements, or UI overlays, into
distinct rendering layers.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/stage" title='WeaveStageNode'>

The WeaveStageNode node is the root canvas container in Weave.js. It serves as the entry point
for rendering all other visual or layout Nodes and manages the overall coordinate system.

</Card>

</Cards>

### Collaboration

<Cards>

<Card href="/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/comment" title='WeaveCommentNode'>

The WeaveCommentNode node is a simple customizable shape used to point where comments were added
to the stage by users. Also provides interactivity in order to render headless overlays to create or
view / manage already created comments.

</Card>

</Cards>

### Grouping

<Cards>

<Card href="/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/frame" title='WeaveFrameNode'>

The WeaveFrameNode node is a container-like visual element used to group and organize other
nodes within a pre-defined boundary. It functions as a structured layout region, often
used to represent panels, sections, or modular components on the canvas.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/group" title='WeaveGroupNode'>

The WeaveGroupNode node is a container for organizing multiple nodes into a single, movable
and transformable unit. It allows you to nest shapes or other groups together, enabling
you to apply transformations like positioning, scaling, rotation,or selection as one
unified object.

</Card>

</Cards>

### Drawing

<Cards>

<Card href="/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/connector" title='WeaveConnectorNode'>

The WeaveConnectorNode node is a complex node that display a sticky line between two nodes predefined
anchor points.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/ellipse" title='WeaveEllipseNode'>

The WeaveEllipseNode node is a simple, versatile primitive shape used to render ellipses
elements on the canvas. It supports customizable properties such as position, axis radius, fill color,
stroke and more.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/image" title='WeaveImageNode'>

The WeaveImageNode node allows you to render images directly onto the canvas. It supports
properties like position, scale, opacity, and filters.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/rectangle" title='WeaveRectangleNode'>

The WeaveRectangleNode node is a simple, versatile primitive shape used to render rectangular
elements on the canvas. It supports customizable properties such as position, size, fill color,
stroke, corner radius and more.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/regular-polygon" title='WeaveRegularPolygonNode'>

The WeaveRegularPolygonNode node is a simple, versatile primitive shape used to render regular polygons
elements on the canvas. It supports customizable properties such as position, radius, sides, fill color,
stroke and more.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/star" title='WeaveStarNode'>

The WeaveStarNode node is a simple, versatile primitive shape used to render star
elements on the canvas. It supports customizable properties such as position, inner and outer radius,
fill color, stroke and more.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/stroke" title='WeaveStrokeNode'>

The WeaveStrokeNode node represents the recommended way to render free-hand lines on the canvas.
It supports features like stroke color, width, dash patterns.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/stroke-single" title='WeaveStrokeSingleNode'>

The WeaveStrokeSingleNode node represents the recommended way to render single-stroke lines on the canvas.
It supports features like stroke color, width, dash patterns and you can define also the line tips as:
arrow, circle or square.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/text" title='WeaveTextNode'>

The WeaveTextNode node is used to display editable or static text on the canvas. It supports
rich styling options including font size, family, color, alignment, and line height.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/video" title='WeaveVideoNode'>

The WeaveVideoNode node allows you to render and play videos directly onto the canvas.

</Card>

</Cards>

#### Deprecated

<Cards>

<Card href="/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/arrow" title='WeaveArrowNode (deprecated)'>

The WeaveArrowNode node is a simple, versatile primitive shape used to render arrow
elements on the canvas. It supports customizable properties such as position, several segments,
fill color, stroke and more.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/line" title='WeaveLineNode (deprecated)'>

The WeaveLineNode node represents a customizable straight or curved line on the canvas.
It supports features like multiple points, stroke color, width, dash patterns, and
smoothing options.

</Card>

</Cards>

### Support

<Cards>

<Card href="/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/measure" title='WeaveMeasureNode'>

The WeaveMeasureNode node is a complex node that display the distance between two points in the canvas.
It needs a reference measure, a measure unit, and a reference distance from the canvas to
calculate the scale and set the measures correctly.

</Card>
