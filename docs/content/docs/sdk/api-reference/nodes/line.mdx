## Overview

The [WeaveLineNode](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/nodes/line/line.ts)
class represents a multi-point line or path on the Weave.js canvas. It is a versatile and essential node type for
building connectors, freehand drawings, flow diagrams, annotations, and visual paths in collaborative environments.

Built on top of Konva’s [Line](https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.Line.html) class shape under the hood, the WeaveLineNode
offers full control over the line’s geometry, style, and behavior—all synchronized in real time across users.

Lines are ideal for:

- Drawing connectors between nodes (e.g., in flowcharts, mind maps, and diagrams).
- Allowing freehand sketching or pen/brush tools.
- Building visual relationships or paths between visual elements.
- Enabling annotation layers in collaborative tools.

The class extends the [WeaveNode](/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/node) class
