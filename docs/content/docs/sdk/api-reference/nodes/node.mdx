description: Blueprint for the Node API

## Overview

The abstract [WeaveNode](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/nodes/node.ts)
class is the foundational building block for all nodes in the Weave.js ecosystem. It provides
a common structure and behavior that all other specific nodes (like rectangles, text, images,
frames, groups, etc.) extend.

By centralizing shared functionality—such as positioning, transformations, event handling,
and real-time updates—WeaveNodeBase ensures consistency, efficiency, and extensibility
across the entire node system. Also providing a same syntax for all nodes, make them easier
to understand.

All nodes must extend this class.

## Import

```shell
import { WeaveNode } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

## Type

All nodes must define a property:

```ts
nodeType: string;
```

Which defines the node identity, for example the node that handles an image it's `nodeType` is
`image`. The `nodeType` must be unique among other nodes.

## JSON Model

A node state must be represented using a JSON model, for this we based on React component
JSON representation, lets call this the `WeaveStateElement`, and take a look at it TypeScript
definition:

```json
type WeaveStateElement = {
  key: string, // (1)
  type: string, // (2)
  props: {
    [key: string]: unknown; // (3)
    id?: string;
    nodeType?: string;
    children?: WeaveStateElement[]; // (4)
  }
}
```

- **(1)**: `key` property, nothing more that an unique identifier of the node.
- **(2)**: `type` property, defines the kind of node this element represents, for example: rectangle,
  text, image, etc.
- **(3)**: `props.key`: defines a property (or properties) of the node, like its color, position, etc.
  A node can define all the properties it need. It's necessary that the type of the value is a primitive:
  string, number, boolean, object, array or null, mainly because the element must be serializable via JSON.
- **(4)**: `props.children`: define the child nodes of this node. This is the property that makes the
  model hierarchical. Order matters.

## Methods

### getNodeType

```ts
getNodeType(): string
```

This method returns the `nodeType` property of the node.

### getSelectionPlugin

```ts
getSelectionPlugin(): WeaveNodesSelectionPlugin | null
```

This method returns the `WeaveNodesSelectionPlugin` if is registered on the Weave class instance.
If not registered returns `null`.

### isSelecting

```ts
isSelecting(): boolean
```

This method returns `true` if the Selection Tool is active, `false` otherwise.

### isNodeSelected

```ts
isNodeSelected(ele: Konva.Node): boolean
```

This method returns `true` if the specified node is selected, `false` otherwise.

## Abstract Methods

### createNode

```ts
createNode(key: string, props: WeaveElementAttributes): WeaveStateElement
```

This method creates a JSON model of the node, based on the previous explained model.

### createInstance

```ts
createInstance(props: WeaveElementAttributes): WeaveElementInstance
```

This method converts the node JSON model representation into a Konva instance. This is
the ideal place to initialize events related to the node for example.

This method is used by the internal React Reconciler to handler the rendering of the
stage.

### updateInstance

```ts
updateInstance(
  instance: WeaveElementInstance,
  nextProps: WeaveElementAttributes
): void
```

This method updates a rendered instance of Konva, that represents a node.

### removeInstance

```ts
removeInstance(instance: WeaveElementInstance): void
```

This method destroys the Konva instance rendered, that represents a node.

### toNode

```ts
toNode(instance: WeaveElementInstance): WeaveStateElement
```

This method returns the JSON model representation of the provided Konva instance
that is handled by this Node definition.

## Konva.Node Augmentation

The WeaveNode extend the `Konva.Node` class to define several functions:

---

### getTransformerProperties

```ts
getTransformerProperties(): WeaveNodeTransformerProperties
```

This function allows you to override how when node is selected it can: rotate, resize and if is
resizable which anchors for resizing will be available.

By default, all nodes can rotate, resize and the default anchors are:

```ts
const DEFAULT_ANCHORS_ENABLED: string[] = [
  "top-left",
  "top-center",
  "top-right",
  "middle-right",
  "middle-left",
  "bottom-left",
  "bottom-center",
  "bottom-right",
];
```

---

### movedToContainer

```ts
movedToContainer(): void
```

Function that is called when the node changes from one container to another.

---

### updatePosition

```ts
updatePosition(): void
```

Function that is called when a node updates its position, its useful when trying to move Nodes
my its children and not its parents, check how the [Frame](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/nodes/frame/frame.ts)
node is coded and look for how it uses the `updatePosition` callback.
