## Overview

The [WeaveFrameNode](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/nodes/frame/frame.ts)
class represents a specialized container node in Weave.js designed to act like a framed section or visual panel inside
the canvas. A WeaveFrameNode is used to group and organize nodes visually and logically within a bounded, styled
areaâ€”similar to a "frame" or "workspace" within the larger canvas.

Built on top of the [WeaveGroupNode](/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/group) and extended with additional visual and
interactive features, it provides a structured layout area perfect for modular designs, diagram sections, flowchart stages,
or collaborative workspaces.

Frames are useful for:

- Renders a rectangular frame with optional size, background color, border and title area (depending on design requirements).
- Acts as a container where users can add child nodes that logically belong inside a specific framed area.
- Allows dragging and interacting with the frame itself while maintaining the internal layout of its child nodes.
- Can carry additional metadata (e.g., frame labels, section types, or workflow states) useful for collaborative tooling and
  visual organization.

The class extends the [WeaveNode](/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/node) class
