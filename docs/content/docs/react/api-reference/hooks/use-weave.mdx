description: API reference for the useWeave hook

import { TypeTable } from "fumadocs-ui/components/type-table";

## Overview

The useWeave hook is a core utility from the Weave.js React Helper library that gives you
direct access to the Weave.js store context within your React components. It provides everything
you access to Weave.js instance API.

Remember that in order to use the useWeave hook you need to wrap your app (or part of it) with
the [WeaveProvider](/docs/react/api-reference/providers/weave-provider).

## Import

```shell
import { useWeave } from "@inditextech/weavejs-react";
```

## Store schema

The store is based on [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction) state
state management solution.

Its schema or structure is the following:

```ts
interface WeaveRuntimeState {
  instance: Weave | null;
  appState: WeaveState;
  status: WeaveStatus;
  connection: {
    status: string;
  };
  room: {
    loaded: boolean;
  };
  users: WeaveConnectedUsersChanged;
  undoRedo: {
    canUndo: boolean;
    canRedo: boolean;
  };
  zoom: {
    value: number;
    canZoomIn: boolean;
    canZoomOut: boolean;
  };
  selection: {
    nodes: WeaveSelection[];
    node: WeaveStateElement | undefined;
  };
  actions: {
    active: boolean;
    actual: string | undefined;
  };
  setInstance: (newInstance: Weave | null) => void;
  setStatus: (newStatus: WeaveStatus) => void;
  setAppState: (newAppState: WeaveState) => void;
  setConnectionStatus: (newConnectionStatus: string) => void;
  setRoomLoaded: (newStatus: boolean) => void;
  setUsers: (newUsers: WeaveConnectedUsersChanged) => void;
  setCanUndo: (newCanUndo: boolean) => void;
  setCanRedo: (newCanRedo: boolean) => void;
  setZoom: (newZoom: number) => void;
  setCanZoomIn: (newCanZoomIn: boolean) => void;
  setCanZoomOut: (newCanZoomOut: boolean) => void;
  setSelectedNodes: (newSelectedNodes: WeaveSelection[]) => void;
  setNode: (newNode: WeaveStateElement | undefined) => void;
  setActualAction: (newActualAction: string | undefined) => void;
}
```

## Usage

Being the store based on Zustand, usage is pretty straight-forward, we just
instantiate the hook and we pass a function as parameter, that receives the state
as parameter and from there we can reduce to the part of the state we need,
like this:

```tsx
import { useWeave } from "@inditextech/weavejs-react";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const nodesSelected = useWeave((state) => state.selection.nodes);

  return <div>{`Nodes selected: ${nodesSelected.length}`}</div>;
};
```
