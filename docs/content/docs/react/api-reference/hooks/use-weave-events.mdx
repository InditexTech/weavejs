---

## Overview

The useWeaveEvents hook is a core utility from the Weave.js React Helper library that setups
the some events in order to manage them in the internal state using the [useWeave](/docs/react/api-reference/hooks/use-weave)
hook, the events setup are:

- `onZoomChange`
- `onNodesChange`
- `onConnectedUsersChange`

Remember that in order to use the useWeaveEvents hook you need to wrap your app (or part of it) with
the [WeaveProvider](/docs/react/api-reference/providers/weave-provider).

## Import

```shell
import { useWeaveEvents } from "@inditextech/weave-react";
```

## Usage

Usage is pretty straight-forward, we just instantiate the hook like this:

```tsx
import { useWeaveEvents } from "@inditextech/weave-react";

const MyComponent = () => {
  useWeaveEvents();

  return <div>{`Events initialized`}</div>;
};
```
