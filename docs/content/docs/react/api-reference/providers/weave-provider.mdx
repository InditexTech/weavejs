import { TypeTable } from "fumadocs-ui/components/type-table";

## Overview

The WeaveProvider is a core component from the React Helper library that initializes and
provides Weave.js context to your React application. It sets up the needed elements for real-time
collaboration and canvas rendering:

- Store
- Nodes
- Plugins
- Actions
- Fonts

By wrapping your app (or part of it) with WeaveProvider, you can make use of the [useWeave](/docs/react/api-reference/hooks/use-weave)
hook to access the API of the Weave instance.

## Import

```shell
import { WeaveProvider } from "@inditextech/weave-react";
