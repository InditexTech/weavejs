## FAQ

Here are some common questions developers often ask.

<Accordions className="bg-transparent">
  <Accordion
    id="ui-frameworks-usage"
    title="Can I use Weave.js with any UI framework?"
  >
    Yes, Weave.js is framework-agnostic by design.

    While we provide helper utilities for React to streamline integration, you can also use Weave.js with other frameworks like Vue or Svelte.
    For those, additional setup or custom wrappers may be required and are not currently covered in this documentation.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    id="frontend-and-backend-single-artifact"
    title="Can I deploy the frontend and backend on a single artifact?"
  >
    Yes, you can bundle the frontend and backend together.
    
    This is a common approach when using full-stack frameworks like Next.js, Express, or Vite with a Node.js server.
    However, for production deployments, we recommend separating the frontend and backend into distinct artifacts.
