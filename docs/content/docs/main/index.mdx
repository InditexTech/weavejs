## Introduction

Weave.js is a modular library that streamlines the **development of visual
collaborative web applications** built on-top of an HTML5 canvas, designed with a
robust architecture, **Weave.js** enables developers to extend functionality
seamlessly.

Ideal for building applications such as whiteboards, diagram editors and design
platforms, Weave.js provides the flexibility and scalability needed for modern,
canvas-based collaborative tools.

### Terminology

**Canvas**: The [HTML5 Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/canvas)
is a powerful web API that provides a drawing surface within the browser. It allows
developers to render 2D graphics, such as shapes, images, animations, and visual interfaces, using JavaScript.

Unlike HTML elements, canvas content is pixel-based and doesn’t retain a DOM structure,
making it ideal for high-performance, dynamic visuals like games, design tools,
and collaborative drawing apps—like those built with Weave.js.

**CRDT**: A CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) is a data structure designed to
automatically resolve conflicts in distributed systems, especially in real-time
collaborative applications. It allows multiple users to update shared data
simultaneously, and guarantees that all changes will merge consistently across
devices—without requiring a central server or manual conflict resolution.

CRDTs are the foundation of real-time sync in Weave.js (via [Yjs](https://yjs.dev)),
making collaboration smooth, reliable, and resilient—even under network latency or
disconnection.

Although not required, some basic knowledge of [Konva.js](https://konvajs.org/docs/overview.html)
would be useful for further customizations.

## FAQ

Some common questions you may encounter.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion
    id="ui-frameworks-usage"
    title="Can I use Weave.js with any UI framework?"
  >
    Yes, you can use Weave.js with any UI framework, but we recommend to use it with React.

    Weave.js is framework-agnostic at its core, meaning the rendering and collaboration logic
    can be integrated into different environments.

    We provide and maintain a React utility to make the integration with React more seamlessly. If you're
    using another framework (like Vue or Svelte), integration is possible, but may require additional
    setup or custom wrappers not provided by this documentation.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    id="frontend-and-backend-single-artifact"
    title="Can I deploy the frontend and backend on a single artifact?"
  >
    Yes, you can deploy both the frontend and backend of a Weave.js app as a single artifact.
    This is a common approach, especially when using full-stack frameworks like Next.js, Express, or Vite
    with a Node server.

    You can bundle the frontend and serve it alongside the backend (e.g., a using a Weave.js store) from
    the same server or deployment unit.

    Nonetheless we recommend to use separate artifacts for the frontend and the backend.
