import { Tab, Tabs } from "fumadocs-ui/components/tabs";

This Quickstart will guide you through getting your first real-time collaborative
canvas project up and running — including both the backend and frontend — in just a
few minutes.

**Weave.js** is designed to make building collaborative visual tools simple,
composable, and extendable, and our CLI tool helps you bootstrap everything quickly
and easily.

## What You’ll Set Up

- A backend server that handles real-time synchronization using a Weave.js Store
  provider, in the case of this quickstart we will use the [Weave.js Store WebSockets](/docs/main/build/stores/websockets-store).
- A minimal frontend application powered by Weave.js, ready to render a collaborative
  canvas with live updates.

## Quickstart

### Scaffold the backend project

First lets create the backend server that will handle all the real-time synchronization
using a Weave.js Store provider, in this case we will use the [Weave.js Store WebSockets](/docs/main/build/stores/websockets-store).

Open a terminal on your preferred folder and execute the following command:

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm create weave-backend-app
```

```bash tab="npm"
npm create weave-backend-app
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn create weave-backend-app
```

This command will launch Weave.js create backend CLI with the following steps:

1. **Project name**: type the name of the folder where the backend project will be created.
2. **Select the store**: for this quickstart select the store named,

   `Express.js: Weave.js Websockets Store`

3. **Install dependencies automatically**: select `Yes`, this will install the
   necessary dependencies of the project.

After the CLI finishes execute the following:

```bash tab="pnpm"
cd [backend-project-name]
pnpm run dev
```

```bash tab="npm"
cd [backend-project-name]
npm run dev
```

```bash tab="yarn"
cd [backend-project-name]
yarn run dev
```

This will startup the backend server on `http://localhost:8080`. To check if everything is
OK, open a browser and type the URL `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health`, you should see a:

```json
{ "status": "OK" }
```

on the screen when navigating to the URL if everything is up and running.

### Scaffold the frontend project

Now let's create the frontend application on top of Next.js and powered by Weave.js,
this will render the UI and canvas with live updates.

Open a terminal on the same parent folder as the backend side project and execute the
following command:

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm create weave-frontend-app
```

```bash tab="npm"
npm create weave-frontend-app
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn create weave-frontend-app
```

This command will launch Weave.js create frontend CLI with the following steps:

1. **Project name**: type the name of the folder where the frontend project will be
   created.
2. **Select the store**: for this quickstart select the store named,

   `Next.js: Weave.js Websockets Store`

3. **Install dependencies automatically**: select `Yes`, this will install the
   necessary dependencies of the project.

After the CLI finishes execute the following:

```bash tab="pnpm"
cd [frontend-project-name]
pnpm run dev
```

```bash tab="npm"
cd [frontend-project-name]
npm run dev
```

```bash tab="yarn"
cd [frontend-project-name]
yarn run dev
```

This will startup the Next.js frontend application on `http://localhost:3030`. Open
a browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:3030`, you should see the following
screen (be patient Next.js takes some time compiling the pages):

<div className="flex justify-center items-center *:max-w-[600px] bg-gradient-to-br from-fd-primary/10 rounded-xl border">
  ![Enter room page of the Weave.js project](/images/scaffolding/enter-room.png)
</div>

</div>

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Run the application

To run the collaborative tool, just:

1. Type the room name you want to join.
2. Type your username.
3. Press the `ENTER THE ROOM` button.

Once the room is loaded (remember pages take time to compile) you should see this
screen:

<div className="flex justify-center items-center *:max-w-[600px] bg-gradient-to-br from-fd-primary/10 rounded-xl border">
  ![Room page of the Weave.js project](/images/scaffolding/room.png)
</div>

Try adding a rectangle and enjoy!

## Next steps

Now that you've completed the quickstart, you're ready to dive deeper into Weave.js and unlock its
full potential. Here are some of our recommended next steps:

### Explore the Architecture

To better understand Weave.js [architecture](/docs/main/build) and to learn
how to build modular and interactive tools, learn how Weave.js is structured under
the hood and get familiar with core concepts like:

- [Nodes](/docs/main/build/nodes),
- [Plugins](/docs/main/build/plugins),
- and [Actions](/docs/main/build/actions).

### Review the API Reference

Dive into [API reference](/docs/sdk) to explore all available methods, utilities,
and configuration options. This is your go-to resource as you start building more advanced features.
