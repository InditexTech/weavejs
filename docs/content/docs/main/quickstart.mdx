import { Tab, Tabs } from "fumadocs-ui/components/tabs";

**Weave.js** is a framework for building collaborative visual tools. It's composable, extendable, and includes a CLI for quickly scaffolding projects.

In this quickstart, you will learn how to set up your first real-time collaborative canvas project with Weave.js.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you meet the [requirements](/docs/main/requirements).

## What you will set up

- An [Express backend server](/docs/main/application-structure#backend-artifact) that handles real-time synchronization using a Weave.js Store provider.
- A [Next.js frontend application](/docs/main/application-structure#frontend-artifact) that uses Weave.js to render a collaborative canvas with live updates.

## Step by step

### Scaffold the backend project

First, create the backend server that will handle all the real-time synchronization using a Weave.js Store provider.
In this case, we use the [Weave.js Store WebSockets](/docs/main/build/stores/websockets-store).

Open a terminal on your preferred folder and execute the following command:

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm create weave-backend-app
```

```bash tab="npm"
npm create weave-backend-app
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn create weave-backend-app
```

This command will launch Weave.js create backend CLI with the following steps:

1. **Project name:**  The folder name where the backend project will be created (e.g. `my-service`).
2. **Select the store:**  For this quickstart, select the store named:

    **Express.js: Weave.js Websockets Store**

3. **Install dependencies automatically:** Select **YES**.  This will install the necessary dependencies of the project.

After the CLI finishes execute the following:

```bash tab="pnpm"
cd [backend-project-name]
pnpm run dev
```

```bash tab="npm"
cd [backend-project-name]
npm run dev
```

```bash tab="yarn"
cd [backend-project-name]
yarn run dev
```

This will start the backend server at `http://localhost:8080`. 

To verify everything is running correctly, open a browser and enter the URL `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health`.

You should see the following response:

```json
{ "status": "OK" }
```

### Scaffold the frontend project

Now let's create the frontend application on top of Next.js and powered by Weave.js.
This will render the UI and canvas with live updates.

Open a terminal on the same parent folder as the backend side project and execute the following command:

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm create weave-frontend-app
```

```bash tab="npm"
npm create weave-frontend-app
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn create weave-frontend-app
```

This command will launch Weave.js create frontend CLI with the following steps:

1. **Project name:**  The folder name where the frontend project will be created (e.g. `my-app`).

2. **Select the store:**  For this quickstart, select the store named:

    **Express.js: Weave.js Websockets Store**

3. **Install dependencies automatically:** Select **YES**.  This will install the necessary dependencies of the project.

After the CLI finishes execute the following:

```bash tab="pnpm"
cd [frontend-project-name]
pnpm run dev
```

```bash tab="npm"
cd [frontend-project-name]
npm run dev
```

```bash tab="yarn"
cd [frontend-project-name]
yarn run dev
```

This will start the Next.js frontend application at `http://localhost:3030`.

<Callout title="Self-signed certificate warning">
When running `npm run dev`, you might see a warning about self-signed certificates.
This is expected, Next.js is setting up HTTPS for local development and may prompt for your system password. 
It is a one-time setup.
</Callout>

Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3030`. You should see the following screen (please be patient, as Next.js may take a moment to compile the pages):

<div className="flex justify-center items-center *:max-w-[600px] bg-gradient-to-br from-fd-primary/10 rounded-xl border">
  ![Enter room page of the Weave.js project](/images/scaffolding/enter-room.png)
</div>

</div>

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Run the application

To run the collaborative tool, follow these steps:

1. Enter the room name you want to join.
2. Type your username.
3. Press the **ENTER THE ROOM** button.

Once the room is loaded (note that pages may take some time to compile), you should see the following screen:

<div className="flex justify-center items-center *:max-w-[600px] bg-gradient-to-br from-fd-primary/10 rounded-xl border">
  ![Room page of the Weave.js project](/images/scaffolding/room.png)
</div>

Try adding a rectangle and enjoy!

## Next steps

Now that you have completed the quickstart, you are ready to dive deeper into Weave.js and unlock its full potential. 
Here are some of our recommended next steps:

### Explore the building blocks

To learn how to build modular and interactive tools, explore how Weave.js is structured under the hood and get familiar with core concepts like:

- [Nodes](/docs/main/build/nodes)
- [Plugins](/docs/main/build/plugins)
- [Actions](/docs/main/build/actions)

### Review the API Reference

Dive into [API reference](/docs/sdk) to explore all available methods, utilities, and configuration options.
This is your go-to resource as you start building more advanced features.
