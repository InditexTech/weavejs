description: Store that uses the WebSockets API as the transport layer
---

## Introduction

The WebSocket Store is a store for Weave.js that uses the [WebSockets API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)
as the transport layer to enable real-time collaboration over the internet. Built on top of
Yjsâ€™s y-websocket provider, it connects all clients to a central server that manages updates
and syncs shared state almost instantly.

It supports features like user presence, shared document syncing, and optional data persistence
on the backend side.

## Server frameworks supported

On the server side we provide some utilities to setup the backend server.

As today we support this server-side frameworks:

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)

<Callout title="Other server frameworks">
  For other server types, you can take a look at the code and build your own support.

On our [roadmap](/docs/main/roadmap) we will inform when we will give support to other
server frameworks.

## Usage

Check the [WebSocket store](/docs/store-websockets) package API reference for an overview
of how to use it both:

- [Server-side](/docs/store-websockets#backend-side-usage) or
- [Frontend-side](/docs/store-websockets#frontend-side-usage)

## Client events

When the store client tries to connect, we provide an event were we return the connection status,
the event is named `onStoreConnectionStatusChange`, and it returns the actual connection status,
being this status:

```ts
const WEAVE_STORE_CONNECTION_STATUS = {
  ["ERROR"]: "error",
  ["CONNECTING"]: "connecting",
  ["CONNECTED"]: "connected",
  ["DISCONNECTED"]: "disconnected",
} as const;

type WeaveStoreConnectionStatusKeys =
  keyof typeof WEAVE_STORE_CONNECTION_STATUS;
type WeaveStoreConnectionStatus =
  (typeof WEAVE_STORE_CONNECTION_STATUS)[WeaveStoreConnectionStatusKeys];

type WeaveStoreOnStoreConnectionStatusChangeEvent = WeaveStoreConnectionStatus;
```

## Client connectivity flow

We've prepared this simple diagram showcasing how the connectivity works on the Weave.js instance
when using this store. The lines connecting display the value of the connection `status` returned
on the `onStoreConnectionStatusChange` event.
