## Introduction

A Store in Weave.js is a shared, real-time data layer that keeps all users in sync. It manages
the state of the canvas, including nodes, user presence, and collaboration historyâ€”powered
by Yjs under the hood.

Stores ensure that changes made by one user are instantly reflected for everyone else, and can
be connected to different backends for persistence and network transport. They make building
multiplayer experiences feel as seamless as building a single-user app.

Weave.js includes a set of built-in Stores, but you can also create your own to tailor
functionality to your specific application needs. Specially if you want to use a particular transport.

## Available stores

Weave.js team maintain a set of **stores**, think of them as the core that:

- On the backend, manages the shared-state persistence, replication to other peers and
  handle the awareness events.
- On the frontend, provides a client so, users can connect to the backend and provide
  all the real-time sync needed to support a collaborative application.

This are the stores:

An store that uses WebSockets as its transport layer.

An store that uses Azure Web PubSub as its transport layer.

## Extensibility

Developers can also build their own **store**, for example to use a custom transport to communicate
the peers of their applications.

An store has two sides:

### Backend server

We don't take an opinion on how to build the server-side of an store, mainly because they are too much
dependant on the transport used.

You can take a look at the code for our provided stores, so you can learn by example how they work:

- [WebSockets store](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/tree/main/code/packages/store-websockets/src/server) server code
- [Azure Web PubSub store](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/tree/main/code/packages/store-azure-web-pubsub/src/server) server code

### Frontend client

In Weave.js a client for a Store is a class that extends the
[WeaveStore](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/stores/store.ts)
abstract class, and implements a set of methods that define the Store behavior.

You can access Weave.js main instance via `this.instance`.

</Callout>

To build an store client, create a class that extends the [WeaveAcWeaveStoretion](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/stores/store.ts)
abstract class, and implement the following methods:

#### connect

```ts
connect(): void
```

The `connect` method is called when an user tries to join a room.

#### disconnect

```ts
disconnect(): void
```

The `disconnect` method is called when an user leaves a room.

#### setAwarenessInfo

```ts
setAwarenessInfo(field: string, value: unknown): void
```

This method set awareness information, for example if you want to inform the metadata of
an user that connected to the room, or to send the pointer information of that user to the
other peers.
