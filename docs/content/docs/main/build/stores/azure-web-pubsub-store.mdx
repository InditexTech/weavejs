title: Azure Web PubSub
description: Store that uses Azure Web PubSub infrastructure as the transport layer
---

## Introduction

The Azure Web PubSub Store is store for Weave.js that leverages [Azure Web PubSub](https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/products/web-pubsub)
as the transport layer. Built on top of Yjs, it uses Azure's scalable infrastructure
to broadcast updates and sync shared state across all connected clients.

This store is ideal for applications that need enterprise-grade reliability,
scalability, and easy integration with other Azure services. It enables Weave.js apps
to support seamless real-time collaboration with minimal setup and strong cloud support.

It supports features like user presence, shared document syncing, and optional data persistence
on the backend side.

## Server frameworks supported

On the server side we provide some utilities to setup the backend server.

As today we support this server-side frameworks:

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)

<Callout title="Other server frameworks">
  For other server types, you can take a look at the code and build your own support.

On our [roadmap](/docs/main/roadmap) we will inform when we will give support to other
server frameworks.

## Usage

Check the [Azure Web PubSub store](/docs/store-azure-web-pubsub) package API reference
for an overview of how to use it both:

- [Server-side](/docs/store-azure-web-pubsub#backend-side-usage) or
- [Frontend-side](/docs/store-azure-web-pubsub#frontend-side-usage)

## Server setup

Setup the frontend is easy, you just need to follow this steps on your Express-based backend:

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">
 
### Install the WebSocket Store backend dependencies

First lets install the necessary dependencies on the backend-side:

```shell
npm install canvas @azure/web-pubsub @azure/web-pubsub-express y-protocols yjs @inditextech/weave-store-azure-web-pubsub
```

</div>

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">
 
### Setup the server

Then setup your server as needed, here you have an example of a simple server, where the persistence
is handled on the file system:

<include lang="ts" meta='title="server.ts"'>
  ../../../examples/build/stores/azure-web-pubsub-server.ts
</include>

File explanation:

- **`(1)`**: Import the Weave.js server dependencies.
- **`(2)`**: Define the endpoint, key and hubName of the Azure Web PubSub instance where we will connect.
- **`(3)`**: Instantiate the `WeaveAzureWebPubsubServer` class. Which returns the server utilities to handle
  Azure Web PubSub connections.
- **`(4)`**: Define the Azure Web Pubsub properties.
- **`(5)`**: Define the `fetchRoom` function that handles the `get` part of the persistence, in this
  case we fetch a binary file with the shared-state from the file system if exists.
- **`(6)`**: Define the `persistRoom` function that handles the `set` part of the persistence, in this
  case we save to a file on the file system the shared-state.
- **`(7)`**: Setup the middleware that handles the Azure Web PubSub connections.
- **`(8)`**: Setup a route that is responsible to call the `clientConnect` method of the server in order to
  obtain a secure connection URL to the Azure Web PubSub Hub.
- **`(9)`**: Setup the server routes.
- **`(10)`**: Start the server.

When an user tries to join a room, it calls the defined route with the room Id where he
want to join, then the `WeaveAzureWebPubsubServer` using the `clientConnect` function, call the Azure Web PubSub
Hub to extract a secure connection and this URL is passed as response to the client. Then the client connects to
this URL and the server does the rest: persistence, handling the messages sent over the connection, etc.

## Client setup

Setup the frontend is easy, you just need to follow this steps:

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">
 
### Install the WebSocket Store frontend dependency

First lets install the necessary dependencies for the frontend client:

```shell
npm install @inditextech/weave-store-azure-web-pubsub
```

</div>

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">
 
### Setup the client on the Weave instance

Then you need to add the Azure Web PubSub store client to the Weave instance in order to handle
the connection when the user tries to join a room. This is done:

```ts
import { WeaveStoreAzureWebPubsub } from "@inditextech/weave-store-azure-web-pubsub/client"; // (1)

const roomId = "MyRoom"; // (2)

const store = new WeaveStoreAzureWebPubsub( // (3)
  {
    getUser, // (4)
    undoManagerOptions: {
      captureTimeout: 500,
    }, // (5)
  },
  {
    roomId, // (6)
    url: http://localhost:1234/api/v1/rooms/${roomId}/connect`, // (7)
  }
);

const instance = new Weave(
  {
    ...
    store, // (8)
  },
  ...
);
```

Explanation:

- **`(1)`**: Import the Weave.js client dependencies.
- **`(2)`**: Define the room Id to connect to.
- **`(3)`**: Instantiate the `WeaveStoreAzureWebPubsub` class. Which returns the Azure Web PubSub store client.
- **`(4)`**: Define the `getUser` function that return the metadata of the user that wants to connect.
- **`(5)`**: We customize the `captureTimeout` of the Undo-Redo manager of the store, to capture changes every 500ms.
- **`(6)`**: We set the room Id where we want to connect to.
- **`(7)`**: Define url where we want to connect and fetch the connection URL to the Azure Web PubSub.
- **`(8)`**: Set the instantiated store to the Weave instance.
