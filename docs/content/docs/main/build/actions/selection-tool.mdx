import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";

## Introduction

## Dependencies

This action needs also registered on the Weave instance the following:

- [Nodes selection](/docs/main/build/plugins/nodes-selection) plugin

## Usage

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="1. Import the action" id="import-action">
    Start by importing the action with the following import:

    ```ts
    import { WeaveSelectionToolAction } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Register the action" id="register-action">
    Then register the action on the Weave class instance.

    ```ts
    const instance = new Weave({
      ...
      actions: [
        ...,
        new WeaveSelectionToolAction(), // [!code ++]
      ]
    })
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Setup the action trigger" id="setup-action-trigger">
    Setup on a button or any element on the UI the user can trigger, an action
    to trigger the action. For example on a button on React:

    ```tsx
    import { useWeave } from "@inditextech/weave-react";

    const MySelectionToolTriggerComponent = () => {
      const instance = useWeave((state) => state.instance);

      const triggerTool = React.useCallback(() => {
        instance.triggerAction("selectionTool");
      }, [instance])

      return (
        <button onClick={triggerTool}>Selection Tool</button>
      )
    }
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="4. Trigger the action" id="trigger-the-action">
    Finally as an user trigger the UI element that launches the action.

    When enabled, it allows users to interactively select nodes using the
    [Nodes Selection](/docs/main/build/plugins/node-selection) plugin. This action
    doesn’t handle selection logic itself—instead, it simply activates or deactivates
    selection capabilities in the UI.

  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
