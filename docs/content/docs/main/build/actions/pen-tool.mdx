description: Add line segments to the canvas
---

import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";
import { Kbd } from "@/components/kbd";

## Introduction

This action allows users to draw continuos lines on the canvas with N segments, by
clicking N times to define the N segments. This tool is ideal for sketching, annotating,
or creating custom shapes.

Each line is captured as a Line Node with configurable styling, and is instantly
synchronized across all connected users.

## Dependencies

This action needs also registered on the Weave instance the following:

- [Line](/docs/main/build/nodes/line) node

## Usage

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="1. Import the action" id="import-action">
    Start by importing the action with the following import:

    ```ts
    import { WeavePenToolAction } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Register the action" id="register-action">
    Then register the action on the Weave class instance.

    ```ts
    const instance = new Weave({
      ...
      actions: [
        ...,
        new WeavePenToolAction(), // [!code ++]
      ]
    })
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Setup the action trigger" id="setup-action-trigger">
    Setup on a button or any element on the UI the user can trigger, an action
    to trigger the action. For example on a button on React:

    ```tsx
    import { useWeave } from "@inditextech/weave-react";

    const MyPenToolTriggerComponent = () => {
      const instance = useWeave((state) => state.instance);

      const triggerTool = React.useCallback(() => {
        instance.triggerAction("penTool");
      }, [instance])

      return (
        <button onClick={triggerTool}>Pen Tool</button>
      )
    }
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="4. Trigger the action" id="trigger-the-action">
    Finally as an user trigger the UI element that launches the action.

    When active the user will iterate on the following steps:

    - **Click** or **Touch** on the canvas, to define a segment start point.
    - **Click** or **Touch** again on the canvas, to define a segment final point.

    When the user is satisfied with the segments:

    - On non-touch devices, press the <Kbd keys={["Enter"]} /> or <Kbd keys={["Esc"]} /> keys.
    - On touch devices, trigger the [Selection Tool](/docs/main/build/actions/selection-tool).

    Then the line with the N defined segments is added to the canvas as a fully functional
    nodeâ€”ready. This action integrates seamlessly with Weave.js's real-time state system,
    ensuring the new element appears instantly for all connected users.
