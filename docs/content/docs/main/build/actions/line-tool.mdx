## Introduction

This action allows users to draw a simple line on the canvas by click-and-drag. Also when the
user press shift, the line is snapped to a defined set of angles.

Each line is captured as a Line Node with configurable styling, and is instantly
synchronized across all connected users.

## Dependencies

This action needs registered on the Weave instance the following elements:

- [Line](/docs/main/build/nodes/line) node

## Usage

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Import the Action

Start by importing the action:

```ts
import { WeaveLineToolAction } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Register the Action

Then register the action on the [Weave](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave) class instance.

```ts
const instance = new Weave({
  ...
  actions: [
    ...,
    new WeaveLineToolAction(), // [!code ++]
  ]
})
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Setup the action trigger

Setup on a button or any element on the UI the user can interact with on the action event:

```ts
instance.triggerAction("lineTool");
```

---

For example on a button on React:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { useWeave } from "@inditextech/weave-react";

const MyLineToolTriggerComponent = () => {
  const instance = useWeave((state) => state.instance);

  const triggerTool = React.useCallback(() => {
    instance.triggerAction("lineTool");
  }, [instance]);

  return <button onClick={triggerTool}>Line Tool</button>;
};
```

### Trigger the action

Finally a final user trigger the UI element that launches the action.

---

When active the user will follow this steps:

- **Click** or **Touch** on the canvas and drag to define the line.
- Release **Click** or **Touch** to add the defined line to the canvas.

You can also press **Shift** to snap the line to a set of predefined angles.

This action integrates seamlessly with Weave.js's real-time state system,
ensuring the new element appears instantly for all connected users.
