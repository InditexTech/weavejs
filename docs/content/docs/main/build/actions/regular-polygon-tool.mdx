- [Regular Polygon](/docs/main/build/nodes/regular-polygon) node

## Usage

<Accordions className="bg-transparent">
  <Accordion title="1. Import the action" id="import-action">
    Start by importing the action with the following import:

    ```ts
    import { WeaveRegularPolygonToolAction } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Register the action" id="register-action">
    Then register the action on the Weave class instance.

    ```ts
    const instance = new Weave({
      ...
      actions: [
        ...,
        new WeaveRegularPolygonToolAction(), // [!code ++]
      ]
    })
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Setup the action trigger" id="setup-action-trigger">
    Setup on a button or any element on the UI the user can trigger, an action
    to trigger the action. For example on a button on React:

    ```tsx
    import { useWeave } from "@inditextech/weave-react";

    const MyRegularPolygonToolTriggerComponent = () => {
      const instance = useWeave((state) => state.instance);

      const triggerTool = React.useCallback(() => {
        instance.triggerAction("regularPolygonTool");
      }, [instance])

      return (
        <button onClick={triggerTool}>Regular Polygon Tool</button>
      )
    }
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="4. Trigger the action" id="trigger-the-action">
    Finally as an user trigger the UI element that launches the action.

    When active the user can:

    - **Click** on the canvas, it will create a regular polygon with a default size.
    - **Touch** on the canvas, it will create a regular polygon with a default size.
    - **Click & drag** to create a regular polygon and define its radius.

    Once clicked or click-drag finishes, the regular polygon is added to the canvas as a fully functional
    nodeâ€”ready. This action integrates seamlessly with Weave.js's real-time state system,
    ensuring the new element appears instantly for all connected users.
