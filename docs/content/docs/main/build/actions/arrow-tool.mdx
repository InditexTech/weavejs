![Arrow Tool action on use on the Weave.js showcase](/images/actions/arrow-tool.gif)

import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";
import { Kbd } from "@/components/kbd";

## Introduction

This action enables users to create new arrow nodes on the canvas.

## Dependencies

This action needs registered on the Weave instance the following elements:

- [Arrow](/docs/main/build/nodes/arrow) node
- [Line](/docs/main/build/nodes/line) node

## Usage

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Import the Action

Start by importing the action:

```ts
import { WeaveArrowToolAction } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Register the Action

Then register the action on the [Weave](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave) class instance.

```ts
const instance = new Weave({
  ...
  actions: [
    ...,
    new WeaveArrowToolAction(), // [!code ++]
  ]
})
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Setup the action trigger

Setup on a button or any element on the UI the user can interact with on the action event:

```ts
instance.triggerAction("arrowTool");
```

---

For example on a button on React:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { useWeave } from "@inditextech/weave-react";

const MyArrowToolTriggerComponent = () => {
  const instance = useWeave((state) => state.instance);

  const triggerTool = React.useCallback(() => {
    instance.triggerAction("arrowTool");
  }, [instance]);

  return <button onClick={triggerTool}>Arrow Tool</button>;
};
```

### Trigger the action

Finally a final user trigger the UI element that launches the action.

---

When the tool is active the user can:

- **Click** or **Touch** on the canvas, to define an arrow segment start point.
- **Click** or **Touch** again on the canvas, to define the arrow final segment point.

When the user is satisfied with the arrow segments:

- On non-touch devices, press the <Kbd keys={["Enter"]} /> or <Kbd keys={["Esc"]} /> keys.
- On touch devices, trigger the [Selection Tool](/docs/main/build/actions/selection-tool).

Then the arrow with the N defined segments is added to the canvas as a fully functional
nodeâ€”ready. This action integrates seamlessly with Weave.js's real-time state system,
ensuring the new element appears instantly for all connected users.
