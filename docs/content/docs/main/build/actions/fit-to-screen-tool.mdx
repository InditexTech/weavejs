![Fit to Screen Tool action on use on the Weave.js showcase](/images/actions/fit-to-screen-tool.gif)

## Introduction

This action automatically adjusts the zoom and position of the Stage to ensure all
visible nodes fit neatly within the viewport. It's perfect for resetting the view,
getting a quick overview of the entire workspace, or re-centering after navigation.

## Dependencies

This action needs also registered on the Weave instance the following:

- [Stage zoom](/docs/main/build/plugins/stage-zoom) plugin

## Usage

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Import the Action

Start by importing the action:

```ts
import { WeaveFitToScreenToolAction } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Register the Action

Then register the action on the [Weave](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave) class instance.

```ts
const instance = new Weave({
  ...
  actions: [
    ...,
    new WeaveFitToScreenToolAction(), // [!code ++]
  ]
})
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Setup the action trigger

Setup on a button or any element on the UI the user can interact with on the action event:

```ts
instance.triggerAction("fitToScreenTool");
```

---

For example on a button on React:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { useWeave } from "@inditextech/weave-react";

const MyFitToScreenToolTriggerComponent = () => {
  const instance = useWeave((state) => state.instance);

  const triggerTool = React.useCallback(() => {
    instance.triggerAction("fitToScreenTool");
  }, [instance]);

  return <button onClick={triggerTool}>Fit to Screen Tool</button>;
};
```

### Trigger the action

Finally a final user trigger the UI element that launches the action.

---

When triggered finds the zoom level necessary to fit all the selected nodes
in the viewport and center on them, so they can be entirely visible.
