## Introduction

This action automatically adjusts the zoom and position of the Stage to ensure all
visible nodes fit neatly within the viewport. It's perfect for resetting the view,
getting a quick overview of the entire workspace, or re-centering after navigation.

## Dependencies

This action needs also registered on the Weave instance the following:

- [Stage zoom](/docs/main/build/plugins/stage-zoom) plugin

## Usage

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="1. Import the action" id="import-action">
    Start by importing the action with the following import:

    ```ts
    import { WeaveFitToScreenToolAction } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Register the action" id="register-action">
    Then register the action on the Weave class instance.

    ```ts
    const instance = new Weave({
      ...
      actions: [
        ...,
        new WeaveFitToScreenToolAction(), // [!code ++]
      ]
    })
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Setup the action trigger" id="setup-action-trigger">
    Setup on a button or any element on the UI the user can trigger, an action
    to trigger the action. For example on a button on React:

    ```tsx
    import { useWeave } from "@inditextech/weave-react";

    const MyFitToScreenToolTriggerComponent = () => {
      const instance = useWeave((state) => state.instance);

      const triggerTool = React.useCallback(() => {
        instance.triggerAction("fitToScreenTool");
      }, [instance])

      return (
        <button onClick={triggerTool}>Fit to Screen Tool</button>
      )
    }
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="4. Trigger the action" id="trigger-the-action">
    Finally as an user trigger the UI element that launches the action.

    When triggered finds the zoom level necessary to fit all the nodes of the canvas in the
    viewport and center on them, so they can be entirely visible.

  </Accordion>
