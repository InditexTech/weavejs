This action allows users to create frame nodes by clicking and position the frame on
the canvas. A frame acts as a visual container for organizing other nodes, often used
to group related content, define sections, or build modular layouts.

## Dependencies

- [Frame](/docs/main/build/nodes/frame) node

## Usage

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="1. Import the action" id="import-action">
    Start by importing the action with the following import:

    ```ts
    import { WeaveFrameToolAction } from "@inditextech/weavejs-sdk";
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Register the action" id="register-action">
    Then register the action on the Weave class instance.

    ```ts
    const instance = new Weave({
      ...
      actions: [
        ...,
        new WeaveFrameToolAction(), // [!code ++]
      ]
    })
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Setup the action trigger" id="setup-action-trigger">
    Setup on a button or any element on the UI the user can trigger, an action
    to trigger the action. For example on a button on React:

    ```tsx
    import { useWeave } from "@inditextech/weavejs-react";

    const MyFrameToolTriggerComponent = () => {
      const instance = useWeave((state) => state.instance);

      const triggerTool = React.useCallback(() => {
        instance.triggerAction("frameTool");
      }, [instance])

      return (
        <button onClick={triggerTool}>Frame Tool</button>
      )
    }
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="4. Trigger the action" id="trigger-the-action">
    Finally as an user trigger the UI element that launches the action.

    When active the user:

    - Clicks on an empty canvas space to add the frame.

    Then the frame is added to the canvas as a fully functional node—ready.
    This action integrates seamlessly with Weave.js's real-time state system,
    ensuring the new element appears instantly for all connected users.
