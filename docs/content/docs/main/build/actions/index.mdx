## Introduction

Actions are the core mechanism for handling user-driven changes in Weave.js. Whether
you're adding a node, moving elements, updating properties, or triggering a custom behavior,
Actions provide a structured, trackable way to apply changes to the shared state.

Actions help keep your application logic clean and consistent, and collaborative. In Weave.js,
if something meaningful happens—it’s probably through an Action.

Weave.js includes a set of built-in Actions, but you can also create your own to tailor
functionality to your specific application needs.

## Action lifecycle

Weave.js action lifecycle is pretty simple:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
stateDiagram-v2
  A: Weave instance is started
  B: Actions are registered
  C: getName() is called on each action
  D: Rendering cycle begins
  E: First render
  F: init() is called on each action
  [*] --> A
  A --> B
  state B {
    C --> [*]
  }
  B --> D
  state D {
    E --> F
    F --> [*]
  }
  D --> [*]`}
/>

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Weave instance is started

</div>

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Actions are registered

The `getName` method is used to identify the action.

</div>

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Rendering cycle

After the first render, the `init` method of every action is called.

</div>
</div>

<Callout title="Decoupled from the lifecycle">

The following methods are called outside the lifecycle:

- When an user want to trigger an action, the `trigger` function is called.
- When the action finishes or the user cancel the action, the `cleanup` function is called.

</Callout>

## Available actions

Weave.js team maintain a set of **actions**, think of them as how the users interact with
the canvas to build visual collaborative applications. This are the actions:

### UX Tools

<Cards>

<Card href="/docs/main/build/actions/move-tool" title='Move Tool'>

Allows users to enable/disable the panning of canvas. When enabled the user can pan the canvas
at its will.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/main/build/actions/selection-tool" title='Selection Tool'>

Allows users to enable/disable the selection mode of the canvas. When enabled the users can
select nodes, move then, resize them, etc.

</Card>

</Cards>

### Nodes Tools

<Cards>

<Card href="/docs/main/build/actions/rectangle-tool" title='Rectangle Tool'>

Enables users to create new rectangle nodes on the canvas.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/main/build/actions/pen-tool" title='Pen Tool'>

Enables users to create continuos lines on the canvas with N segments on the canvas.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/main/build/actions/brush-tool" title='Brush Tool'>

Enables users to paint freeform strokes on the canvas, similar to a digital brush.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/main/build/actions/image-tool" title='Image Tool'>

Enables users to add images to the canvas by selecting a file.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/main/build/actions/text-tool" title='Text Tool'>

Enables users to add new text nodes to the canvas by clicking or touching on it.

</Card>

</Cards>

### Grouping Tools

<Cards>

<Card href="/docs/main/build/actions/frame-tool" title='Frame Tool'>

Enables users to create frame nodes by clicking on the canvas.

</Card>

</Cards>

### Zooming Tools

<Cards>

<Card href="/docs/main/build/actions/zoom-in-tool" title='Zoom In Tool'>

Enables users to incrementally zoom into the canvas, providing a more detailed view of
content.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/main/build/actions/zoom-out-tool" title='Zoom Out Tool'>

Enables users to incrementally zoom out the canvas, providing a more general view of
content.

</Card><Card href="/docs/main/build/actions/fit-to-screen-tool" title='Fit to Screen Tool'>

Automatically adjusts the zoom and position of the canvas to ensure all visible nodes
fit neatly within the viewport.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/main/build/actions/fit-to-selection-tool" title='Fit to Selection Tool'>

Automatically adjusts the zoom and position of the canvas to ensure all selected nodes
fit neatly within the viewport.

</Card>

</Cards>

### Export Tools

<Cards>

<Card href="/docs/main/build/actions/export-stage-tool" title='Export Stage Tool'>

Automatically adjusts the zoom and position of the canvas to ensure all visible nodes
fit neatly within the viewport, and then proceeds to export the viewport as an image.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/main/build/actions/export-node-tool" title='Export Node Tool'>

Automatically adjusts the zoom and position of the canvas to ensure all selected nodes
fit neatly within the viewport, and then proceeds to export the viewport as an image.

</Card>

</Cards>

## Extensibility

Developers can also build their own **actions**, empowering this way their applications
with new interactions closer to the needs of their applications.

### Base class

In Weave.js a Action is a class that extends the
[WeaveAction](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/actions/action.ts)
abstract class, and implements a set of methods that define the Action behavior.

<Callout title="Access the Weave instance">

You can access Weave.js main instance via `this.instance`.

</Callout>

To build an action, create a class that extends the [WeaveAction](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/actions/action.ts)
abstract class, and implement the following methods:

#### getName

```ts
getName(): string
```

The `getName` method returns the name of the action, used as an identifier
on the Weave instance.

#### init

```ts
init?(): void;
```

The `init` method is optional, and is called after the first render of the
Weave instance. It's a good place to initialize the action state, events, etc.

#### trigger

```ts
trigger(cancelAction: () => void, params?: unknown): unknown;
```

When a user wants to call an action, the `trigger` method is called, it receives
the following parameters:

- `cancelAction: () => void`: a callback that we call when then user wants to cancel
  the action, or if the action itself finishes.
- `params?: unknown`: an optional parameter that the user can pass to the action, dependencies
  on the action implementation.

#### internalUpdate

```ts
internalUpdate?(): void;
```

An action instance is wrapped with the
[Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy)
object, which enables us to intercept the `get` and `set` operations on the action instance.

The `internalUpdate` method is called when the for example the `props` property of the instance
is updated (via get/set), allowing us to dynamically pass parameters to an action after this is
triggered.

#### cleanup

```ts
cleanup?(): void;
```

The `cleanup` method is called when the action finishes or the user cancel the action. It's a
good place to clean up the action state, events, etc.
