![Connector Tool action on use on the Weave.js showcase](/images/actions/connector-tool.gif)

## Introduction

This action enables users to create new connector nodes on the canvas.

## Dependencies

This action needs registered on the Weave instance the following element:

- [Connector](/docs/main/build/nodes/connector) node

## Usage

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Import the Action

Start by importing the action:

```ts
import { WeaveConnectorToolAction } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Register the Action

Then register the action on the [Weave](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave) class instance.

```ts
const instance = new Weave({
  ...
  actions: [
    ...,
    new WeaveConnectorToolAction(), // [!code ++]
  ]
})
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Setup the action trigger

Setup on a button or any element on the UI the user can interact with on the action event:

```ts
instance.triggerAction("connectorTool");
```

---

For example on a button on React:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { useWeave } from "@inditextech/weave-react";

const MyConnectorToolTriggerComponent = () => {
  const instance = useWeave((state) => state.instance);

  const triggerTool = React.useCallback(() => {
    instance.triggerAction("connectorTool");
  }, [instance]);

  return <button onClick={triggerTool}>Connector Tool</button>;
};
```

### Trigger the action

Finally a final user trigger the UI element that launches the action.

---

When active the user can follow this steps:

- **Hover** on a node to see their anchor points.
- **Click** on an anchor point, it will define the start point for the connector.
- **Click** on another anchor point, it will define the end point for the connector.

Then the connector node is added to the canvas as a fully functional node.
This action integrates seamlessly with Weave.js's real-time state system,
ensuring the new element appears instantly for all connected users.
