![Text Tool action on use on the Weave.js showcase](/images/actions/text-tool.gif)

## Introduction

This action allows users to add new text nodes to the canvas by clicking or touching
on it. Once placed, the node becomes immediately editable, enabling users to type
inline and customize the content.

This action is perfect for adding labels, annotations, or descriptions in collaborative
environments. Created text nodes are fully interactive, styleable, and synchronized
across all connected users in real time.

## Dependencies

This action needs registered on the Weave instance the following element:

- [Text](/docs/main/build/nodes/text) node

## Usage

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Import the Action

Start by importing the action:

```ts
import { WeaveTextToolAction } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Register the Action

Then register the action on the [Weave](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave) class instance.

```ts
const instance = new Weave({
  ...
  actions: [
    ...,
    new WeaveTextToolAction(), // [!code ++]
  ]
})
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Setup the action trigger

Setup on a button or any element on the UI the user can interact with on the action event:

```ts
instance.triggerAction("textTool");
```

For example on a button on React:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { useWeave } from "@inditextech/weave-react";

const MyTextToolTriggerComponent = () => {
  const instance = useWeave((state) => state.instance);

  const triggerTool = React.useCallback(() => {
    instance.triggerAction("textTool");
  }, [instance]);

  return <button onClick={triggerTool}>Text Tool</button>;
};
```

### Trigger the action

Finally a final user trigger the UI element that launches the action.
