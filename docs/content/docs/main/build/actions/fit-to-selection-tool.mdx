<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Import the Action

Start by importing the action:

```ts
import { WeaveFitToSelectionToolAction } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Register the Action

Then register the action on the [Weave](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave) class instance.

```ts
const instance = new Weave({
  ...
  actions: [
    ...,
    new WeaveFitToSelectionToolAction(), // [!code ++]
  ]
})
```

</div>

```ts
instance.triggerAction("fitToSelectionTool");
```

For example on a button on React:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { useWeave } from "@inditextech/weave-react";

const MyFitToSelectionToolTriggerComponent = () => {
  const instance = useWeave((state) => state.instance);

  const triggerTool = React.useCallback(() => {
    instance.triggerAction("fitToSelectionTool");
  }, [instance]);

  return <button onClick={triggerTool}>Fit to Selection Tool</button>;
};
```
