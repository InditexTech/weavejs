  ![Brush Tool action on use on the Weave.js

</div>

## Introduction

This action enables users to paint freeform strokes on the canvas, similar to a
digital brush. Unlike the [Pen Tool](/docs/main/build/actions/pen-tool) action,
which focuses on clean vector lines, the **WeaveBrushToolAction** emphasizes style,
thickness, and expressive drawing, creating [Line](/docs/main/build/nodes/line) nodes
with a more natural, hand-drawn feel.

It’s ideal for sketching, highlighting, or adding visual flair to collaborative
sessions.

## Dependencies

This action needs registered on the Weave instance the following elements:

- [Line](/docs/main/build/nodes/line) node

## Usage

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Import the Action

Start by importing the action:

```ts
import { WeaveBrushToolAction } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Register the Action

Then register the action on the [Weave](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave) class instance.

```ts
const instance = new Weave({
  ...
  actions: [
    ...,
    new WeaveBrushToolAction(), // [!code ++]
  ]
})
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Setup the action trigger

Setup on a button or any element on the UI the user can interact with on the action event:

```ts
instance.triggerAction("brushTool");
```

---

For example on a button on React:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { useWeave } from "@inditextech/weave-react";

const MyBrushToolTriggerComponent = () => {
  const instance = useWeave((state) => state.instance);

  const triggerTool = React.useCallback(() => {
    instance.triggerAction("brushTool");
  }, [instance]);

  return <button onClick={triggerTool}>Brush Tool</button>;
};
```

### Trigger the action

Finally a final user trigger the UI element that launches the action.

---

When active the user:

- **Click-press** or **Touch-press** on the canvas, to define a brush line.

Then the freeform line is added to the canvas as a fully functional node—ready.
This action integrates seamlessly with Weave.js's real-time state system,
ensuring the new element appears instantly for all connected users.
