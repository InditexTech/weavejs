title: Brush Tool
description: Paint freeform strokes on the canvas
---

import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";

## Introduction

This action enables users to paint freeform strokes on the canvas, similar to a
digital brush. Unlike the [Pen Tool](/docs/main/build/actions/pen-tool) action,
which focuses on clean vector lines, the **WeaveBrushToolAction** emphasizes style,
thickness, and expressive drawing, creating Line Nodes with a more natural,
hand-drawn feel.

It’s ideal for sketching, highlighting, or adding visual flair to collaborative
sessions.

## Dependencies

This action needs also registered on the Weave instance the following:

- [Line](/docs/main/build/nodes/line) node

## Usage

<Accordions className="bg-transparent">
  <Accordion title="1. Import the action" id="import-action">
    Start by importing the action with the following import:

    ```ts
    import { WeaveBrushToolAction } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Register the action" id="register-action">
    Then register the action on the Weave class instance.

    ```ts
    const instance = new Weave({
      ...
      actions: [
        ...,
        new WeaveBrushToolAction(), // [!code ++]
      ]
    })
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Setup the action trigger" id="setup-action-trigger">
    Setup on a button or any element on the UI the user can trigger, an action
    to trigger the action. For example on a button on React:

    ```tsx
    import { useWeave } from "@inditextech/weave-react";

    const MyBrushToolTriggerComponent = () => {
      const instance = useWeave((state) => state.instance);

      const triggerTool = React.useCallback(() => {
        instance.triggerAction("brushTool");
      }, [instance])

      return (
        <button onClick={triggerTool}>Brush Tool</button>
      )
    }
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="4. Trigger the action" id="trigger-the-action">
    Finally as an user trigger the UI element that launches the action.

    When active the user:

    - **Click-press** or **Touch-press** on the canvas, to define a brush line.

    Then the freeform line is added to the canvas as a fully functional node—ready.
    This action integrates seamlessly with Weave.js's real-time state system,
    ensuring the new element appears instantly for all connected users.

  </Accordion>
