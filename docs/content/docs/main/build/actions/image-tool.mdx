description: Add an image to the canvas
---

![Image Tool action on use on the Weave.js showcase](/images/actions/image-tool.gif)

## Introduction

This action allows users to add images to the canvas by selecting a file. Once added,
the image is rendered as an Image Node, ready for positioning, resizing, and collaboration.

This action supports various image formats: jpeg, gif & png. Ideal for visual
references, diagrams, or creative content.

## Dependencies

This action needs also registered on the Weave instance the following:

- [Image](/docs/main/build/nodes/image) node

## Usage

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Import the Action

Start by importing the action:

```ts
import { WeaveImageToolAction } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Register the Action

Then register the action on the [Weave](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave) class instance.

```ts
const instance = new Weave({
  ...
  actions: [
    ...,
    new WeaveImageToolAction(), // [!code ++]
  ]
})
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Setup the action trigger

Setup on a button or any element on the UI the user can interact with on the action event:

```ts
const { finishUploadCallback } = instance.triggerAction("imageTool");
```

Then select the image to upload (by showcasing a file select to the end user), and when the user
selects an image, call the `finishUploadCallback`, passing as parameter the URL where the image
can be accessed.

---

For example on a button on React:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { useWeave } from "@inditextech/weave-react";

const MyImageToolTriggerComponent = () => {
  const inputFileRef = React.useRef<any>(null);
  const instance = useWeave((state) => state.instance);
  const [showSelectFile, setShowSelectFile] = React.useState<boolean>(false);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (showSelectFile && inputFileRef.current) {
      inputFileRef.current.click();
      setShowSelectFileImage(false);
    }
  }, [instance, showSelectFile, setShowSelectFileImage]);

  const handleUploadFile = React.useCallback(
    async (file) => {
      // Upload file to you storage / this is dummy, just an example
      const imageURL = await uploadImage(file);
      const { finishUploadCallback } = instance.triggerAction("imageTool");
      finishUploadCallback(imageURL);
    },
    [instance]
  );

  return (
    <>
      <input
        type="file"
        accept="image/png,image/gif,image/jpeg"
        name="image"
        style={{ display: "none" }}
        ref={inputFileRef}
        onClick={() => {
          inputFileRef.current.value = null;
        }}
        onChange={(e) => {
          const file = e.target.files?.[0];
          if (file) {
            handleUploadFile(file);
          }
        }}
      />
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          setShowSelectFileImage(true);
        }}
      >
        Image Tool
      </button>
    </>
  );
};
```

### Trigger the action

Finally a final user trigger the UI element that launches the action.

---

When active the user:

- Select the image to upload.
- Image is uploaded with the API the developer choses or has available.
- Once the image is uploaded, the user can click or touch on the canvas to place it.

Then the image is added to the canvas as a fully functional nodeâ€”ready.
This action integrates seamlessly with Weave.js's real-time state system,
ensuring the new element appears instantly for all connected users.
