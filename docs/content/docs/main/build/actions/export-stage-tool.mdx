![Export Stage Tool action on use on the Weave.js showcase](/images/actions/export-stage-tool.gif)

## Introduction

This action allows users to capture and download the current canvas Stage view as an
image file (jpeg, png or gif). It takes a snapshot of the entire Stage where are nodes
are visible, preserving the visual state of nodes, styling, and layout.

## Dependencies

This action needs also registered on the Weave instance the following:

- [Nodes selection](/docs/main/build/plugins/nodes-selection) plugin

## Usage

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Import the Action

Start by importing the action:

```ts
import { WeaveExportStageToolAction } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Register the Action

Then register the action on the [Weave](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave) class instance.

```ts
const instance = new Weave({
  ...
  actions: [
    ...,
    new WeaveExportStageToolAction(), // [!code ++]
  ]
})
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Setup the action trigger

Setup on a button or any element on the UI the user can interact with on the action event:

```ts
instance.triggerAction("exportStageTool", {
  options: {
    padding: 20, // the exported stage image should have a 20px padding
    pixelRatio: 2, // the exported stage image should have 2x resolution
  },
});
```

For example on a button on React:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { useWeave } from "@inditextech/weave-react";

const MyExportStageToolTriggerComponent = () => {
  const instance = useWeave((state) => state.instance);

  const triggerTool = React.useCallback(() => {
    instance.triggerAction("exportStageTool", {
      options: {
        padding: 20,
        pixelRatio: 2,
      },
    });
  }, [instance]);

  return <button onClick={triggerTool}>Export Node Tool</button>;
};
```

### Trigger the action

Finally a final user trigger the UI element that launches the action.

When triggered fit all the nodes of the canvas in the viewport, center on its and then
proceed to generate an image from it. Allowing to download it.
