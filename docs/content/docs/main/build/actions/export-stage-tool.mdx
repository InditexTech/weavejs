  ![Export Stage Tool action on use on the Weave.js
  showcase](/images/actions/export-stage-tool.gif)
</div>

## Introduction

This action allows users to capture and download the current canvas Stage view as an
image file (jpeg, png or gif). It takes a snapshot of the entire Stage where are nodes
are visible, preserving the visual state of nodes, styling, and layout.

## Dependencies

This action needs also registered on the Weave instance the following:

- [Nodes selection](/docs/main/build/plugins/nodes-selection) plugin

## Usage

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Import the Action

Start by importing the action:

```ts
import { WeaveExportStageToolAction } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Register the Action

Then register the action on the [Weave](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave) class instance.

```ts
const instance = new Weave({
  ...
  actions: [
    ...,
    new WeaveExportStageToolAction(), // [!code ++]
  ]
})
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Setup the action trigger

Setup on a button or any element on the UI the user can interact with on the action event:

```ts
instance.triggerAction("exportStageTool", {
  options: {
    padding: 20, // the exported stage image should have a 20px padding
    pixelRatio: 2, // the exported stage image should have 2x resolution
  },
});
```

---

For example on a button on React:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { useWeave } from "@inditextech/weave-react";

const MyExportStageToolTriggerComponent = () => {
  const instance = useWeave((state) => state.instance);

  const triggerTool = React.useCallback(() => {
    instance.triggerAction("exportStageTool", {
      options: {
        padding: 20,
        pixelRatio: 2,
      },
    });
  }, [instance]);

  return <button onClick={triggerTool}>Export Node Tool</button>;
};
```

### Trigger the action

Finally a final user trigger the UI element that launches the action.

---

When triggered fit all the nodes of the canvas in the viewport, center on its and then
proceed to generate an image from it. Allowing to download it.
