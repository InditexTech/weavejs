import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";

## Introduction

This plugin adds smart alignment assistance by enabling nodes to snap to guides or
other nodes as they are moved or resized. It helps users place elements with
precision, improving layout consistency and visual structure.

It’s especially useful in design tools, diagram editors, and any interface where
visual alignment matters.

## Dependencies

This plugin needs also registered on the Weave instance the following:

- [Nodes selection](/docs/main/build/plugins/nodes-selection) plugin.

## Usage

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="1. Import the plugin" id="import-plugin">
    Start by importing the action with the following import:

    ```ts
    import { WeaveNodesSnappingPlugin } from "@inditextech/weavejs-sdk";
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Register the plugin" id="register-plugin">
    Then register the action on the Weave class instance.

    ```ts
    const instance = new Weave({
      ...
      plugins: [
        ...,
        new WeaveNodesSnappingPlugin(), // [!code ++]
      ]
    })
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Use the plugin" id="use-the-plugin">
    The user now can snap the nodes when moved or resized relative to other nodes or
    some guides like the center of the relative canvas.

  </Accordion>
