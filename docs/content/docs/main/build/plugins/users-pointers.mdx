  ![Users pointers plugin on use on the Weave.js
  showcase](/images/plugins/users-pointers.gif)
</div>

## Introduction

This plugin displays real-time cursors or pointers for all connected users on the
canvas. Each pointer is typically labeled with the user's name or avatar, allowing
collaborators to see where others are pointing, clicking, or working in real time.

This plugin enhances awareness and coordination in multi-user sessions, making
collaboration feel more intuitive and dynamic. It integrates with Weave.js's
presence system and updates instantly as users move their mouse or interact with
the canvas.

## Usage

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Import the Plugin

Start by importing the plugin:

```ts
import { WeaveUsersPointersPlugin } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Register the Plugin

Then register the plugin on the [Weave](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave) class instance.

```ts
const instance = new Weave({
  ...
  plugins: [
    ...,
    new WeaveUsersPointersPlugin(), // [!code ++]
  ]
})
```

You can also customize the pointer visual style and font style. For more information check the
[WeaveUsersPointersPlugin](/docs/sdk/api-reference/plugins/users-pointers) plugin API.

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Use the plugin

Once the plugin is registered if more than one users are connected to the [room](/docs/main/glossary#room),
the instance user will be able to see the other users pointers, and the others users can see theirs.
