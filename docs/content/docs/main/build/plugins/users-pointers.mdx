## Introduction

This plugin displays real-time cursors or pointers for all connected users on the
canvas. Each pointer is typically labeled with the user's name or avatar, allowing
collaborators to see where others are pointing, clicking, or working in real time.

This plugin enhances awareness and coordination in multi-user sessions, making
collaboration feel more intuitive and dynamic. It integrates with Weave.js's
presence system and updates instantly as users move their mouse or interact with
the canvas.
