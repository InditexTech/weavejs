title: Stage Drop Area
description: Activate support to drop elements on the canvas

import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";

## Introduction

This plugin enables drag-and-drop support on the canvas, allowing users to drop
elements—such as shapes, files, or custom components—directly onto the Stage. It
captures drop events, calculates drop positions, and can trigger custom Actions or
workflows based on the dropped content.

This plugin is ideal for building intuitive drag-to-create interfaces, asset import
features, or external integrations (e.g., dropping images or nodes from a sidebar).
It integrates smoothly with Weave.js's action system for precise and flexible drop
handling.

## Usage

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="1. Import the plugin" id="import-plugin">
    Start by importing the action with the following import:

    ```ts
    import { WeaveStageDropAreaPlugin } from "@inditextech/weavejs-sdk";
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Register the plugin" id="register-plugin">
    Then register the action on the Weave class instance.

    ```ts
    const instance = new Weave({
      ...
      plugins: [
        ...,
        new WeaveStageDropAreaPlugin({ // [!code ++]
          onStageDrop, // callback that is called when an element is dropped on the stage [!code ++]
          doUploadFile, // callback that is called when a file is dropped on the stage [!code ++]
        }), // [!code ++]
      ]
    })
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Use the plugin" id="use-the-plugin">
    Listen when the user drops an element or a file on the canvas, then react
    accordingly.
