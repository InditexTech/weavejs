## Introduction

This plugin enables drag-and-drop support on the canvas, allowing users to drop
elements—such as shapes, files, or custom components—directly onto the Stage. It
captures drop events, calculates drop positions, and can trigger custom Actions or
workflows based on the dropped content.

This plugin is ideal for building intuitive drag-to-create interfaces, asset import
features, or external integrations (e.g., dropping images or nodes from a sidebar).
It integrates smoothly with Weave.js's action system for precise and flexible drop
handling.

## Usage

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Import the Plugin

Start by importing the plugin:

```ts
import { WeaveStageDropAreaPlugin } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Register the Plugin

Then register the plugin on the [Weave](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave) class instance.

```ts
const instance = new Weave({
  ...
  plugins: [
    ...,
    new WeaveStageDropAreaPlugin(), // [!code ++]
  ]
})
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Use the plugin

Once the plugin is registered you can add a listener with the [Weave](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave)
instance [Events API](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave#events) that listen to the event named `onStageDrop`.

```ts
// Import types
import type { WeaveStageDropPluginOnStageDropEvent } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";

instance.addEventListener<WeaveStageDropPluginOnStageDropEvent>(
  "onStageDrop",
  () => {
    console.log("user dropped something");
  }
);
```

With this callback you can know when the users drops something to the stage, now to specifically know
what the user dropped, you can for example, on the `onDragStart` [event](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/dragstart_event)
define on the `window` object (being global) a property with metadata of the element that started
dragging and retrieve / perform and action / clean it on the callback.
