## Introduction

This plugin enables smooth zooming in and out of the canvas, allowing users to
focus on details or get an overview of the entire workspace. It supports mouse wheel,
trackpad gestures, and programmatic control, with customizable zoom levels.

This plugin enhances navigation and usability in complex visual tools like
whiteboards, diagrams, or design interfaces. It integrates seamlessly with the
panning and resize plugins to provide a fully scalable and interactive canvas
experience.

      ...
      plugins: [
        ...,
        new WeaveStageZoomPlugin({ // [!code ++]
          zoomSteps, // an array of zoom levels to snap to [!code ++]
          defaultZoom, // the initial zoom level [!code ++]
          onZoomChange, // callback that is called when the zoom level changes [!code ++]
        }), // [!code ++]
