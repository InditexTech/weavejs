## Introduction

This plugin enables users to duplicate selected nodes using familiar keyboard
shortcuts like Ctrl/Cmd + C and Ctrl/Cmd + V, or through options in a context-menu.
It preserves node structure, styles, and metadata, allowing for quick reuse and
layout iteration.

Supports multi-node copy & copy & paste between tabs. It integrates
seamlessly with the selection and action systems, making it a natural part of the
collaborative editing workflow.

## Dependencies

This plugin needs also registered on the Weave instance the following:

- [Nodes selection](/docs/main/build/plugins/nodes-selection) plugin.

## Usage

    ```ts
    import { WeaveCopyPasteNodesPlugin } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Register the plugin" id="register-plugin">
    Then register the action on the Weave class instance.

      ...
      plugins: [
        ...,
        new WeaveCopyPasteNodesPlugin({ // [!code ++]
          onCopy, // callback to listen when the user copies a node or nodes [!code ++]
          onPaste, // callback to listen when the user paste a node or nodes [!code ++]
          onPasteExternal, // TODO [!code ++]
        }), // [!code ++]
      ]
    })
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Use the plugin" id="use-the-plugin">
    Users now can copy & paste selected nodes to the actual canvas, or to other canvases
    located on other tabs.
    
    Also depending on your needs:

    - Listen to the `onCopy` callback to know when the user copies a node or nodes,
      for example to showcase a toast for feedback.
    - Listen to the `onPaste` callback to know when the user paste a node or nodes,
      for example to showcase a toast for feedback.
    - Listen to the `onPasteExternal` callback, TODO.
