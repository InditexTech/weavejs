## Introduction

This plugin adds custom right-click menus to the canvas, enabling users to access
context-specific actions—like deleting nodes, duplicating elements, or triggering
custom workflows. It enhances usability by offering quick access to relevant tools
based on the current selection or interaction.

Fully customizable and extensible, making it easy to tailor the experience to your
application's needs.

## Dependencies

This plugin needs also registered on the Weave instance the following:

- [Nodes selection](/docs/main/build/plugins/nodes-selection) plugin.

## Usage

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="1. Import the plugin" id="import-plugin">
    Start by importing the action with the following import:

    ```ts
    import { WeaveContextMenuPlugin } from "@inditextech/weavejs-sdk";
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Register the plugin" id="register-plugin">
    Then register the action on the Weave class instance.

    ```ts
    const instance = new Weave({
      ...
      plugins: [
        ...,
        new WeaveContextMenuPlugin({ // [!code ++]
          xOffset, // define the X offset of the click point  [!code ++]
          yOffset, // define the Y offset of the click point [!code ++]
          onNodeMenu, // callback to listen when the user right-click [!code ++]
        }), // [!code ++]
      ]
    })
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Use the plugin" id="use-the-plugin">
    Listen to changes when user right-clicked on the `onNodeMenu` callback, then
    react accordingly. Something like this:
    
    ```ts
    const instance = new Weave({
      ...
      plugins: [
        ...,
        new WeaveContextMenuPlugin({
          onNodeMenu: ({ instance, selection, point, visible }) => {
            // based on the selection, render the UI of your context menu (options)
            // and then render it on the coordinates provided by point. Remember to
            // handle the context menu screen overflow based on the point provided.
          },
          ...
        }),
      ]
    })
    ```
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
