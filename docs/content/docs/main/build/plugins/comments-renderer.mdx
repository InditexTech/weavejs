title: Comments Renderer
description: Render the comments of a room in a special layer
---

## Introduction

This plugin renders the provided comments (as a model) on a special layer on the canvas,
this layer is not synced using the room state, is independent.

Take into consideration, that the rendering is not automatic, meaning that if:

- Other user adds, changes, or reply a comment
- Yourself add, change or reply to a comment

This will not trigger a re-render of the comments, you need to manually trigger the re-render
when this actions happens, this is intended in order to decouple Weave internal and make the
tool headless from all points of view: UI, Backend and Entity model.

### Import the Plugin

Start by importing the plugin:

```ts
import { WeaveConnectedUsersPlugin } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Register the Plugin

Then register the plugin on the [Weave](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave) class instance.

```ts
const instance = new Weave({
  ...
  plugins: [
    ...,
    new WeaveConnectedUsersPlugin({ // [!code ++]
      config: { // [!code ++]
        model, // here you define some utils to work with your Entity model // [!code ++]
        getUser, // we need the current user model when creating // [!code ++]
        getUserBackgroundColor, // define the background color associated to an user // [!code ++]
        getUserForegroundColor, // define the foreground color associated to an user // [!code ++]
      } // [!code ++]
    }), // [!code ++]
  ]
})
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Use the plugin

Once the plugin is registered you have an API to control when to render the comments:

- `setComments(comments: T[]): void`: this function sets the comments to render, based on your Entity model.
- `render(): void`: this function is the one that renders the comments on the room stage, call it whenever the comments changed.
