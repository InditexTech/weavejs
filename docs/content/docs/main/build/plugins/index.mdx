## Introduction

Plugins are the modular pieces that extend and enhance the functionality of Weave.js.
They allow you to add behavior to the canvas: like selection, zooming, snapping, panning,
keyboard shortcuts, and more, without modifying the core system.

Plugins are designed to be lightweight, composable, and easy to integrate, making it simple
to build rich, interactive experiences. Whether you're enabling multi-selection, managing
drag-and-drop, or integrating custom logic, Plugins are how you supercharge your canvas with
reusable, context-aware features.

Weave.js includes a set of built-in plugins, but you can also create your own to tailor
functionality to your specific application needs.

## Plugin lifecycle

Weave.js plugin lifecycle is pretty simple:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
stateDiagram-v2
  A: Weave instance is started
  B: Plugins are registered
  C: getName() is called on each plugin
  D: Rendering cycle begins
  E: First render completed
  F: onInit() is called on each plugin
  G: Subsequent renders
  H: onRender() is called on each plugin
  [*] --> A
  A --> B
  state B {
    C --> [*]
  }
  B --> D
  state D {
    E --> F
    F --> G
  }
  state G {
    H --> [*]
  }
  G --> G
  D --> [*]`}
/>

<Callout title="Decoupled from the lifecycle">

The following methods are called outside the lifecycle:

- When an user wants to disable the plugin, the `disable` method is called.
- When an user wants to enable the plugin, the `enable` method is called.

## Available plugins

Weave.js team maintain a set of **plugins**, think of them as added functionality to
build visual collaborative applications. This are the plugins:

### Awareness & Presence

<Cards>

<Card href="/docs/main/build/plugins/connected-users" title='Connected Users'>

Gives the list of users currently active in a collaborative session. Ideal as source
information to paint the user list on the UI.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/main/build/plugins/users-pointers" title='Users Pointers'>

Displays real-time cursors or pointers for all connected users on the canvas.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/main/build/plugins/users-selector" title='Users Selector'>

Displays real-time the user selection for all connected users on the canvas.

</Card>

</Cards>

### UX

<Cards>

<Card href="/docs/main/build/plugins/context-menu" title='Context Menu'>

Adds custom right-click menus to the canvas, enabling users to access context-specific
actions

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/main/build/plugins/copy-paste-nodes" title='Copy & Paste Nodes'>

Enables users to copy & paste selected nodes using familiar keyboard shortcuts like
Ctrl/Cmd + C and Ctrl/Cmd + V or through actions on the context menu.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/main/build/plugins/nodes-selection" title='Nodes Selection'>

Enables users to select one or multiple nodes on the canvas through clicks,
shift-clicks, or drag-selection (marquee).

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/main/build/plugins/nodes-snapping" title='Nodes Snapping'>

Adds smart alignment assistance by enabling nodes to snap to guides or other nodes as they
are moved or resized.

</Card>

</Cards>

### Stage

<Cards>

<Card href="/docs/main/build/plugins/stage-drop-area" title='Stage Drop Area'>

Enables drag-and-drop support on the canvas, allowing users to drop elements—such as
shapes, files, or custom components—directly onto the canvas.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/main/build/plugins/stage-grid" title='Stage Grid'>

Adds a visual background grid to the canvas stage, helping users align and position
elements more precisely.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/main/build/plugins/stage-panning" title='Stage Panning'>

Enables users to navigate the canvas by dragging to move around the Stage.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/main/build/plugins/stage-resize" title='Stage Resize'>

Automatically adjusts the canvas size to fit its container or the browser window,
ensuring a responsive and adaptive user experience.

</Card>

<Card href="/docs/main/build/plugins/stage-zoom" title='Stage Zoom'>

Enables smooth zooming in and out of the canvas, allowing users to focus on details
or get an overview of the entire workspace.

</Card>

</Cards>

## Custom Plugins

Developers can also build their own **plugins**, empowering this way their applications
with new features closer to the needs of their applications.

For this we provide an extension mechanism that allows to define your own plugins and use them
on your application.

### WeavePlugin class

In Weave.js a Plugin is a class that extends the
[WeavePlugin](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/plugins/plugin.ts)
abstract class, and implements a set of methods that define the Plugin behavior.

<Callout title="Access the Weave instance">

You can access Weave.js main instance via `this.instance`.

</Callout>

To build a plugin, create a class that extends the [WeavePlugin](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs/blob/main/code/packages/sdk/src/plugins/plugin.ts)
abstract class, and implement the following methods:

#### getName

```ts
getName(): string
```

The `getName` method returns the name of the plugin, used as an identifier
on the Weave instance. The name of the plugin must be unique among other plugins.

#### onInit

```ts
onInit?(): void
```

The `onInit` method is optional, and is called after the first render of the
Weave instance. It's a good place to initialize the plugin state, events, etc.

#### onRender

```ts
onRender?(): void
```

The `onRender` method is optional, and is called on every render of the Weave
instance. It's a good place to update the plugin and render it's changes.

#### enable

```ts
enable(): void
```

The `enable` method is called when the user wants to enable the plugin.

#### disable

```ts
disable(): void
```

The `enable` method is called when the user wants to disable the plugin.
