import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";

## Introduction

This plugin adds a visual background grid to the canvas stage, helping users align
and position elements more precisely. The grid can be rendered as lines or dots, and
supports customizable spacing, color, and style.

Is especially useful for diagramming tools, design interfaces, or any
application where spatial structure improves usability. It integrates seamlessly
with zoom and pan behaviors to ensure the grid remains consistent and responsive
during interactions.

## Usage

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="1. Import the plugin" id="import-plugin">
    Start by importing the action with the following import:

    ```ts
    import { WeaveStageGridPlugin } from "@inditextech/weavejs-sdk";
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Register the plugin" id="register-plugin">
    Then register the action on the Weave class instance.

    ```ts
    const instance = new Weave({
      ...
      plugins: [
        ...,
        new WeaveStageGridPlugin(), // [!code ++]
      ]
    })
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Use the plugin" id="use-the-plugin">
    The user now should be able to see the reference grid.

  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
