import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";

## Introduction

This plugin adds a visual background grid to the canvas stage, helping users align
and position elements more precisely. The grid can be rendered as lines or dots, and
supports customizable spacing, color, and style.

Is especially useful for diagramming tools, design interfaces, or any
application where spatial structure improves usability. It integrates seamlessly
with zoom and pan behaviors to ensure the grid remains consistent and responsive
during interactions.

## Usage

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Import the Plugin

Start by importing the plugin:

```ts
import { WeaveStageGridPlugin } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Register the Plugin

Then register the plugin on the [Weave](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave) class instance.

```ts
const instance = new Weave({
  ...
  plugins: [
    ...,
    new WeaveStageGridPlugin(), // [!code ++]
  ]
})
```

You can also define:

- The type of the grid (by default is a line grid, but it also can be a dot grid).
- The style of the grid (visual colors and appearance).
- The separation of the grid cells.

For more information check the [WeaveStageGridPlugin](/docs/sdk/api-reference/plugins/stage-grid)
plugin API.

The plugin also provides a public API to:

- Enable / disable the grid.
