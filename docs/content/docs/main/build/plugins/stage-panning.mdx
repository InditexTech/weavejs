## Introduction

This plugin enables users to navigate the canvas by dragging to move around the
Stage. It enhances the user experience by allowing intuitive exploration
of large or zoomed-in workspaces, especially in collaborative or diagram-heavy
environments.

This plugin handles input events like mouse drag or touch gestures, and smoothly
updates the Stage’s position. It integrates seamlessly with other plugins like
zoom, grid, and selection—ensuring fluid and natural canvas navigation.
