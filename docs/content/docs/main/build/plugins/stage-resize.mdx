## Introduction

This plugin automatically adjusts the canvas size to fit its container or the
browser window, ensuring a responsive and adaptive user experience. It listens to
window or container resize events and updates the Stage dimensions accordingly.

This plugin is essential for maintaining a seamless layout across different
screen sizes and devices, especially in collaborative environments where
flexibility and visibility are key.

## Usage

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="1. Import the plugin" id="import-plugin">
    Start by importing the action with the following import:

    ```ts
    import { WeaveStageResizePlugin } from "@inditextech/weavejs-sdk";
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Register the plugin" id="register-plugin">
    Then register the action on the Weave class instance.

    ```ts
    const instance = new Weave({
      ...
      plugins: [
        ...,
        new WeaveStageResizePlugin(), // [!code ++]
      ]
    })
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Use the plugin" id="use-the-plugin">
    Now the canvas is automatically resized when the browser windows changes size.

  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
