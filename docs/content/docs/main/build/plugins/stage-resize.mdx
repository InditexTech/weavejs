## Introduction

This plugin automatically adjusts the canvas size to fit its container or the
browser window, ensuring a responsive and adaptive user experience. It listens to
window or container resize events and updates the Stage dimensions accordingly.

This plugin is essential for maintaining a seamless layout across different
screen sizes and devices, especially in collaborative environments where
flexibility and visibility are key.
