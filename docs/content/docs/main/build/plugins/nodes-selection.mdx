description: Activate support to select nodes on the canvas

import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";

## Introduction

This plugin enables users to select one or multiple nodes on the canvas through
clicks (touch), shift-clicks, or drag-selection (marquee). It provides the foundation
for interactions like moving, grouping, editing, or deleting elements.

It handles selection state, visual highlighting, and integrates with other
plugins (like keyboard shortcuts or transformation tools) to enable rich, interactive
workflows. It’s essential for building intuitive, user-friendly collaborative
interfaces.

## Usage

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="1. Import the plugin" id="import-plugin">
    Start by importing the action with the following import:

    ```ts
    import { WeaveNodesSelectionPlugin } from "@inditextech/weavejs-sdk";
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Register the plugin" id="register-plugin">
    Then register the action on the Weave class instance.

    ```ts
    const instance = new Weave({
      ...
      plugins: [
        ...,
        new WeaveNodesSelectionPlugin({ // [!code ++]
          onNodesChange, // callback to listen to node selection changes [!code ++]
          onStageSelection, // callback to listen when the user clicks or touches the canvas, no nodes are selected [!code ++]
        }), // [!code ++]
      ]
    })
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Use the plugin" id="use-the-plugin">
    Listen to changes to the selected nodes, then react accordingly. Something like
    this:
    
    ```ts
    const instance = new Weave({
      ...
      plugins: [
        ...,
        new WeaveContextMenuPlugin({
          onNodesChange: (selectedNodes) => {
            // based on the selection, act accordingly
          },
          onStageSelection: () => {
            // if you need to do something when the user clicks on the stage
            // no nodes are selected
          }
          ...
        }),
      ]
    })
    ```
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
