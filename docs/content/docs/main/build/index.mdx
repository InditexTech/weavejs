## Introduction

Weave.js is designed to help developers build visual collaborative UI applications,
tools that are often complex by nature, involving canvas rendering, rich interactions, and
dynamic real-time state management. To manage all this complexity, Weave.js is built
around three core principles:

- **Simple**: simplicity is at the heart of **Weave.js**. From its declarative API to its
  plugin-friendly design, every part of the library is designed to reduce boilerplate
  and make development a breeze. Whether you're rendering shapes or handling user interactions,
  the goal is to keep things easy to reason about. _Focus on building features, not fighting
  complexity_.
- **Composable**: building complex UI interfaces requires a system that scales well.
  In **Weave.js**, everything is designed with composition in mind. Our building blocks can be
  combined, even among them, to create more sophisticated behaviors. _This approach encourages
  reusability, modularity, and a clear separation of concerns_.
- **Extendable**: no two collaborative tools are the same, and **Weave.js** embraces that
  by being deeply extendable. This makes **Weave.js** adaptable to a wide range of use cases,
  from whiteboards to diagramming tools to visual design platforms. _You can customize nearly
  every aspect, from the canvas behavior, interaction models to rendering logic, without touching
  the core_.

## Building blocks

A building block is typically a simple, well-defined unit—like a shape, a UI component, or a
plugin—that does one thing well. You can mix and match these blocks to assemble more advanced
features or entire applications. **Weave.js** provides a set of well-defined building blocks:

Nodes are the fundamental visual building blocks in Weave.js.

They are primarily based on Konva.js primitives (shapes and groups) and represent everything
rendered on the canvas.

<Card href="/docs/main/build/plugins" icon={<Blocks className="text-blue-300" />} title='Plugins'>

Plugins extend and enhance Weave.js's core functionality.

Whether it's selection handling, canvas panning, zooming, or custom behaviors, plugins allow you to modular
add or override features without cluttering the core logic.

<Card href="/docs/main/build/actions" icon={<Flame className="text-green-300" />} title='Actions'>

Actions are how user interactions are interpreted and executed within Weave.js.

From adding new Nodes to the canvas to triggering selection or transformation, Actions provide a clean and
consistent way to handle event-driven logic.

<Card href="/docs/main/build/stores" icon={<Archive className="text-red-300" />} title='Stores'>

Stores are responsible for managing the shared-state, persist it and the real-time communication between peers.

A Store on the backend, manages the application's shared-state, real-time synchronization and
persistence, on the frontend, a client is provided to connect to the backend.

## Example of building blocks

- A **Node** like a rectangle or text element is a building block of the _visual canvas_.
- A **Plugin** that handles zooming is a building block for _enhancing logic_.
- An **Action** to add a Node to the canvas is a building block for _user workflows_.

Just like LEGO pieces, these building blocks are designed to fit together, letting developers
construct complex behavior without starting from scratch each time.
