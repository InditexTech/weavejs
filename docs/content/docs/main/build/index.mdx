## Building blocks

A building block is typically a simple, well-defined unit—like a shape, a UI component, or a
plugin—that does one thing well. You can mix and match these blocks to assemble more advanced
features or entire applications. **Weave.js** provides a set of well-defined building blocks:

Nodes are the fundamental visual building blocks in Weave.js.

They are primarily based on Konva.js primitives (shapes and groups) and represent everything
rendered on the canvas.

<Card href="/docs/main/build/plugins" icon={<Blocks className="text-blue-300" />} title='Plugins'>

Plugins extend and enhance Weave.js's core functionality.

Whether it's selection handling, canvas panning, zooming, or custom behaviors, plugins allow you to modular
add or override features without cluttering the core logic.

<Card href="/docs/main/build/actions" icon={<Flame className="text-green-300" />} title='Actions'>

Actions are how user interactions are interpreted and executed within Weave.js.

From adding new Nodes to the canvas to triggering selection or transformation, Actions provide a clean and
consistent way to handle event-driven logic.

<Card href="/docs/main/build/stores" icon={<Archive className="text-red-300" />} title='Stores'>

Stores are responsible for managing the shared-state, persist it and the real-time communication between peers.

A Store on the backend, manages the application's shared-state, real-time synchronization and
persistence, on the frontend, a client is provided to connect to the backend.

## Example of building blocks

- A **Node** like a rectangle or text element is a building block of the _visual canvas_.
- A **Plugin** that handles zooming is a building block for _enhancing logic_.
- An **Action** to add a Node to the canvas is a building block for _user workflows_.

Just like LEGO pieces, these building blocks are designed to fit together, letting developers
construct complex behavior without starting from scratch each time.
