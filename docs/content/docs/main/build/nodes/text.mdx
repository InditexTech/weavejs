The Text node is used to display editable or static text on the canvas. Based on
Konva’s [Text](https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.Text.html) shape, it supports rich styling
options including font size, family, color, alignment, and line height.

Text Nodes are essential for labels, annotations, or any UI elements that require
readable content. They can be fully interactive—allowing selection, dragging, and
inline editing.

## Usage

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Import the Node

Start by importing the node:

```ts
import { WeaveTextNode } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Register the Node

Then register the node on the [Weave](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave) class instance.

```ts
const instance = new Weave({
  ...
  nodes: [
    ...,
    new WeaveTextNode(), // [!code ++]
  ]
})
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Use the node

Once the node is registered you can use it on [Actions](/docs/main/build/actions) or
[Plugins](/docs/main/build/plugins) or even other [Nodes](/docs/main/build/nodes).

We provide the action named [Text Tool](/docs/main/build/actions/text-tool) that allows
users to add Text nodes to the application.

---

When the Text node is added to the stage it can behave by three different ways defined by the
property `layout`:

- `auto-all`: makes the node auto-adjust its size (width & height) accordingly to the text
  that it contains.
- `auto-height`: makes the node auto-adjust its height accordingly to the text that it contains.
  The width is fixed and defined by the end user.
- `fixed`: makes the node fixed on both its width & height.
