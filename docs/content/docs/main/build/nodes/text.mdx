import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";

The Text node is used to display editable or static text on the canvas. Based on
Konva’s [Text](https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.Text.html) shape, it supports rich styling
options including font size, family, color, alignment, and line height.

Text Nodes are essential for labels, annotations, or any UI elements that require
readable content. They can be fully interactive—allowing selection, dragging, and
inline editing.

## Usage

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="1. Import the node" id="import-node">
    Start by importing the action with the following import:

    ```ts
    import { WeaveTextNode } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Register the node" id="register-node">
    Then register the node on the Weave class instance.

    ```ts
    const instance = new Weave({
      ...
      nodes: [
        ...,
        new WeaveTextNode(), // [!code ++]
      ]
    })
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Use the node" id="use-the-node">
    TODO

  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
