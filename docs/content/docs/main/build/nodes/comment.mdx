![Comment on Weave.js showcase](/images/nodes/comment.png)

The Comment node is a simple, versatile shape used to point to where an user added a
comment to share with other peers, this node renders a shape that resembles an arrow
pointing to some content on the stage.

When clicked, a function is called in order to render an overlay with the comment
information over a DOM node, on it anyone can deploy an UI / UX to:

- Edit the comment content.
- Render the comment replies.
- Create a new reply.
- Edit a reply.
- Mark the comment as resolved.
- Delete the comment

<Callout title="Not shareable thought the room state" type="warning">
  This node is intended and designed to be used standalone, it doesn't support
  to be shared via the room state mechanism.
</Callout>

## Usage

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Import the Node

Start by importing the node:

```ts
import { WeaveCommentNode } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Register the Node

Then register the node on the [Weave](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave) class instance.

```ts
const instance = new Weave({
  ...
  nodes: [
    ...,
    new WeaveCommentNode({ // [!code ++]
      config: { // [!code ++]
        model, // here you define some utils to work with your Entity model // [!code ++]
        formatDate, // define how to format the dates rendered by Weave.js // [!code ++]
        createComment, // a callback that is called when you need to render the create comment UI // [!code ++]
        viewComment, // a callback that is called when you need to render the view comment UI // [!code ++]
      } // [!code ++]
    }), // [!code ++]
  ]
})
```

<Callout title="UI configuration" type="info">
  Check the [Comment Node](/docs/sdk/api-reference/nodes/comment) API to know
  how it can be customized.
</Callout>

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Use the node

Once the node is registered you can use

- The [Comment tool](/docs/main/build/actions/comment-tool) action to manage the comments of a room.
- The [Comments Renderer plugin](/docs/main/build/plugins/comments-renderer) to render the comments
  on a special layer that is not shared using the room state mechanism.

While the Comment nodes are rendered with the [Comments Renderer plugin](/docs/main/build/plugins/comments-renderer),
interaction with the node is handled here, so if you want to for example view the comment
details, when the Comment node is clicked a callback function is called, so you can render your
Comment UI in order to handle that comment.
