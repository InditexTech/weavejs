import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";

The Image Node allows you to render images directly onto the canvas. Built on top
of Konva’s [Image](https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.Image.html) shape, it supports
properties like position, scale, opacity, and filters.

Image nodes are perfect for adding visual references, icons, or user-uploaded media
to your collaborative canvas. They supporting selection, resizing, and drag-and-drop—and
and can be extended with plugins for features like cropping, masking, or annotations.

## Usage

<Accordions className="bg-transparent">
  <Accordion title="1. Import the node" id="import-node">
    Start by importing the action with the following import:

    ```ts
    import { WeaveImageNode } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Register the node" id="register-node">
    Then register the node on the Weave class instance.

    ```ts
    const instance = new Weave({
      ...
      nodes: [
        ...,
        new WeaveImageNode(), // [!code ++]
      ]
    })
    ```

  </Accordion>
