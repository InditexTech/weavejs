The Image Node allows you to render images directly onto the canvas. Built on top
of Konva’s [Image](https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.Image.html) shape, it supports
properties like position, scale, opacity, and filters.

Image nodes are perfect for adding visual references, icons, or user-uploaded media
to your collaborative canvas. They supporting selection, resizing, and drag-and-drop—and
and can be extended with plugins for features like cropping, masking, or annotations.

## Usage

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Import the Node

Start by importing the node:

```ts
import { WeaveImageNode } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Register the Node

Then register the node on the [Weave](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave) class instance.

```ts
const instance = new Weave({
  ...
  nodes: [
    ...,
    new WeaveImageNode(), // [!code ++]
  ]
})
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Use the node

Once the node is registered you can use it on [Actions](/docs/main/build/actions) or
[Plugins](/docs/main/build/plugins) or even other [Nodes](/docs/main/build/nodes).

We provide an action named [Image Tool](/docs/main/build/actions/image-tool) that allows
users to add Image (one-by-one) nodes to the application.
