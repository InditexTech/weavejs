import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";

The Image Node allows you to render images directly onto the canvas. Built on top
of Konva’s [Image](https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.Image.html) shape, it supports
properties like position, scale, opacity, and filters.

Image nodes are perfect for adding visual references, icons, or user-uploaded media
to your collaborative canvas. They supporting selection, resizing, and drag-and-drop—and
and can be extended with plugins for features like cropping, masking, or annotations.

## Usage

  <Accordion title="1. Import the node" id="import-node">

    ```ts
