import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";

The Layer node is a logical container within the Stage. Based on Konva’s
[Layer](https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.Layer.html), it allows you to separate visual
elements—for example, background grids, interactive elements, or UI overlays—into
distinct rendering layers.

Layers improve rendering control, enabling selective updates, independent z-index
management, and cleaner composition of complex scenes. Nodes rendered within a Layer
share the same coordinate space but can be managed and updated independently.

## Usage

<Callout title="Don't directly use">
  We don't recommend to use this node directly. To define the application
  Layers, use the stores `initialState` configuration property on server-side.
</Callout>

<Accordions className="bg-transparent">
  <Accordion title="1. Import the node" id="import-node">
    Start by importing the action with the following import:

    ```ts
    import { WeaveLayerNode } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Register the node" id="register-node">
    Then register the node on the Weave class instance.

    ```ts
    const instance = new Weave({
      ...
      nodes: [
        ...,
        new WeaveLayerNode(), // [!code ++]
      ]
    })
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Use the node" id="use-the-node">
    TODO

  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
