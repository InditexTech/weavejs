![Measure on the Weave.js showcase](/images/nodes/measure.png)

The Measure node is a complex node used to render a representation of the the distance between
two points on the canvas. It needs:

- A measure unit, e.g. meters, centimeters, milimeters, or inches.
- A reference measure. A distance you previously know based on the measure unit.
- A reference distance. The distance between two points on the canvas that represent the reference
  measure.

## Usage

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Import the Node

Start by importing the node:

```ts
import { WeaveMeasureNode } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Register the Node

Then register the node on the [Weave](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave) class instance.

```ts
const instance = new Weave({
  ...
  nodes: [
    ...,
    new WeaveMeasureNode(), // [!code ++]
  ]
})
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Use the node

Once the node is registered you can use it on [Actions](/docs/main/build/actions) or
[Plugins](/docs/main/build/plugins) or even other [Nodes](/docs/main/build/nodes).

We provide an action named [Measure Tool](/docs/main/build/actions/measure-tool) that
allows users to add Measure nodes to the application in a simple way.
