The Line node represents a customizable straight or curved line on the canvas.
Built on top of Konvaâ€™s [Line](https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.Line.html), it supports
features like multiple points, stroke color, width, dash patterns, and smoothing
options.

Line Nodes are ideal for drawing connectors, paths, or annotations between elements.
They can be static or interactive, and are often used in diagramming tools,
flow editors, and visual programming interfaces.

## Usage

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Import the Node

Start by importing the node:

```ts
import { WeaveLineNode } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Register the Node

Then register the node on the [Weave](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave) class instance.

```ts
const instance = new Weave({
  ...
  nodes: [
    ...,
    new WeaveLineNode(), // [!code ++]
  ]
})
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Use the node

Once the node is registered you can use it on [Actions](/docs/main/build/actions) or
[Plugins](/docs/main/build/plugins) or even other [Nodes](/docs/main/build/nodes).

We provide two actions:

- [Pen Tool](/docs/main/build/actions/pen-tool) that allows users to add Line nodes,
  to the application by specifying all segments one-by-one (a line is a collection of points,
  and lines are rendered among them).
- [Brush Tool](/docs/main/build/actions/brush-tool) that allows users to add Line nodes,
  to the application by free-hand (mouse or digital pencil).
