import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";

The Line node represents a customizable straight or curved line on the canvas.
Built on top of Konvaâ€™s [Line](https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.Line.html), it supports
features like multiple points, stroke color, width, dash patterns, and smoothing
options.

Line Nodes are ideal for drawing connectors, paths, or annotations between elements.
They can be static or interactive, and are often used in diagramming tools,
flow editors, and visual programming interfaces.

## Usage

  <Accordion title="1. Import the node" id="import-node">
