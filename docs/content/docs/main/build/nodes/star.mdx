import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";

The Star node is a simple, versatile primitive shape used to render star
elements on the canvas. Built on top of Konvaâ€™s [Star](https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.Star.html),
it supports customizable properties such as amount of points, position, inner and outer radius, fill color, stroke, radius (on both axis),
and more.

They can also respond to interactions like dragging, resizing,
or selection.

## Usage

<Accordions className="bg-transparent">
  <Accordion title="1. Import the node" id="import-node">
    Start by importing the action with the following import:

    ```ts
    import { WeaveStarNode } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
    ```

  </Accordion>

    Then register the node on the Weave class instance.
