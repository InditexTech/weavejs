import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";

The Arrow node is a simple, versatile primitive shape used to render arrow
elements on the canvas. Built on top of Konvaâ€™s [Arrow](https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.Arrow.html),
it supports customizable properties such as position, several segments, fill color,
stroke and more.

They can also respond to interactions like dragging, resizing, or selection.

## Usage

<Accordions className="bg-transparent">
  <Accordion title="1. Import the node" id="import-node">
    Start by importing the action with the following import:

    ```ts
    import { WeaveArrowNode } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
    ```
