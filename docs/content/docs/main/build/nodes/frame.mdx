import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";

The Frame node is a container-like visual element used to group and organize other
nodes within a pre-defined boundary. It functions as a structured layout region, often
used to represent panels, sections, or modular components on the canvas.

Built using a combination of primitive shapes, the Frame node can include a title,
background, border, and optional interactive handles. It supports nesting of child
Nodes, making it ideal for modular UIs, flow sections, or structured diagrams.

## Usage

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="1. Import the node" id="import-node">
    Start by importing the action with the following import:

    ```ts
    import { WeaveFrameNode } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Register the node" id="register-node">
    Then register the node on the Weave class instance.

    ```ts
    const instance = new Weave({
      ...
      nodes: [
        ...,
        new WeaveFrameNode(), // [!code ++]
      ]
    })
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Use the node" id="use-the-node">
    On a frame you can add any node except for:

    - A Frame itself
    - A [Layer](/docs/main/build/nodes/layer)
    - A [Stage](/docs/main/build/nodes/stage)
