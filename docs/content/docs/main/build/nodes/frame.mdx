The Frame node is a container-like visual element used to group and organize other
nodes within a pre-defined boundary. It functions as a structured layout region, often
used to represent panels, sections, or modular components on the canvas.

Built using a combination of primitive shapes, the Frame node can include a title,
background, border, and optional interactive handles. It supports nesting of child
Nodes, making it ideal for modular UIs, flow sections, or structured diagrams.

## Usage

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Import the Node

Start by importing the node:

```ts
import { WeaveFrameNode } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Register the Node

Then register the node on the [Weave](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave) class instance.

```ts
const instance = new Weave({
  ...
  nodes: [
    ...,
    new WeaveFrameNode(), // [!code ++]
  ]
})
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Use the node

Once the node is registered you can use it on [Actions](/docs/main/build/actions) or
[Plugins](/docs/main/build/plugins) or even other [Nodes](/docs/main/build/nodes).

We provide an action named [Frame Tool](/docs/main/build/actions/ellipse-tool) that
allows users to add Frame nodes to the application.
