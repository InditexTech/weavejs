title: Stage
description: Main node to structure the canvas elements
---

The Stage node is the root canvas container in Weave.js. Based on Konva’s
[Stage](https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.Stage.html), it serves as the entry point
for rendering all other visual or layout Nodes and manages the overall coordinate system.

All Nodes are rendered within the Stage, making it the central hub for your visual
collaborative experience. It’s also where global behaviors—like grid rendering,
selection, or snapping—are initialized and managed.

## Usage

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Import the Node

Start by importing the node:

```ts
import { WeaveStageNode } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Register the Node

Then register the node on the [Weave](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave) class instance.

```ts
const instance = new Weave({
  ...
  nodes: [
    ...,
    new WeaveStageNode(), // [!code ++]
  ]
})
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Use the node

<Callout type="warn">

Don't use this node directly.

</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">

The Stage node is a layering node, it doesn't render anything visual per-se to the end user.

</Callout>

To define your application structure: Stage and Layers,
use the stores `initialState` configuration property on server-side. You can find more information
