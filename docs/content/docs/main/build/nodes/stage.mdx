description: Main node to structure the canvas elements

import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";

The Stage node is the root canvas container in Weave.js. Based on Konva’s
[Stage](https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.Stage.html), it serves as the entry point
for rendering all other visual or layout Nodes and manages the overall coordinate system.

All Nodes are rendered within the Stage, making it the central hub for your visual
collaborative experience. It’s also where global behaviors—like grid rendering,
selection, or snapping—are initialized and managed.

## Usage

<Callout title="Don't directly use">
  We don't recommend to use this node directly. To define the application Stage,
  use the stores `initialState` configuration property on server-side.
</Callout>

<Accordions className="bg-transparent">
  <Accordion title="1. Import the node" id="import-node">
    Start by importing the action with the following import:

    ```ts
    import { WeaveStageNode } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Register the node" id="register-node">
    Then register the node on the Weave class instance.

    ```ts
    const instance = new Weave({
      ...
      nodes: [
        ...,
        new WeaveStageNode(), // [!code ++]
      ]
    })
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Use the node" id="use-the-node">
    TODO

  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
