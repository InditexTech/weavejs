description: Draw an ellipse (or circle) on the canvas

import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";

The Ellipse node is a simple, versatile primitive shape used to render ellipse
elements on the canvas. Built on top of Konvaâ€™s [Ellipse](https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.Ellipse.html),
it supports customizable properties such as position, size, fill color, stroke, radius (on both axis),
and more.

Ellipse nodes are often used as building blocks for UI components, layout guides,
or user-created nodes. They can also respond to interactions like dragging, resizing,
or selection.

## Usage

<Accordions className="bg-transparent">
  <Accordion title="1. Import the node" id="import-node">
    Start by importing the action with the following import:

    ```ts
    import { WeaveEllipseNode } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Register the node" id="register-node">
    Then register the node on the Weave class instance.

    ```ts
    const instance = new Weave({
      ...
      nodes: [
        ...,
        new WeaveEllipseNode(), // [!code ++]
      ]
    })
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Use the node" id="use-the-node">
    TODO

  </Accordion>
