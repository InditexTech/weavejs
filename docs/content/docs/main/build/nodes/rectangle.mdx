The Rectangle node is a simple, versatile primitive shape used to render rectangular
elements on the canvas. Built on top of Konvaâ€™s [Rect](https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.Rect.html),
it supports customizable properties such as position, size, fill color, stroke, corner radius,
and more.

Rectangle nodes are often used as building blocks for UI components, layout guides,
or user-created nodes. They can also respond to interactions like dragging, resizing,
or selection.

## Usage

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Import the Node

Start by importing the node:

```ts
import { WeaveRectangleNode } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Register the Node

Then register the node on the [Weave](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave) class instance.

```ts
const instance = new Weave({
  ...
  nodes: [
    ...,
    new WeaveRectangleNode(), // [!code ++]
  ]
})
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Use the node

Once the node is registered you can use it on [Actions](/docs/main/build/actions) or
[Plugins](/docs/main/build/plugins) or even other [Nodes](/docs/main/build/nodes).

We provide an action named [Rectangle Tool](/docs/main/build/actions/rectangle-tool) that
allows users to add Rectangle nodes to the application.
