import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";

The Rectangle node is a simple, versatile primitive shape used to render rectangular
elements on the canvas. Built on top of Konvaâ€™s [Rect](https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.Rect.html),
it supports customizable properties such as position, size, fill color, stroke, corner radius,
and more.

Rectangle nodes are often used as building blocks for UI components, layout guides,
or user-created nodes. They can also respond to interactions like dragging, resizing,
or selection.

## Usage

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="1. Import the node" id="import-node">
    Start by importing the action with the following import:

    ```ts
    import { WeaveRectangleNode } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Register the node" id="register-node">
    Then register the node on the Weave class instance.

    ```ts
    const instance = new Weave({
      ...
      nodes: [
        ...,
        new WeaveRectangleNode(), // [!code ++]
      ]
    })
    ```

  </Accordion>
