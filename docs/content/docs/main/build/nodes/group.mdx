The Group node is a container for organizing multiple nodes into a single, movable
and transformable unit. Based on Konvaâ€™s [Group](https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.Group.html),
it allows you to nest shapes or other groups together, enabling you to apply
transformations like positioning, scaling, rotation,or selection as one unified object.

Groups are useful for structuring complex UIs, building reusable components, or
enabling drag-and-drop behavior across multiple elements. They help keep your canvas
scene organized and easier to manipulate programmatically.

## Usage

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Import the Node

Start by importing the node:

```ts
import { WeaveGroupNode } from "@inditextech/weave-sdk";
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Register the Node

Then register the node on the [Weave](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave) class instance.

```ts
const instance = new Weave({
  ...
  nodes: [
    ...,
    new WeaveGroupNode(), // [!code ++]
  ]
})
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>

### Use the node

<Callout type="warn">

The Group node is a layering node, it doesn't render anything visual to the end user, its normally
used through the contextual menu to group selected nodes or un-group a group. Check the [Weave](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave)
class API to learn about the [Group Management](/docs/sdk/api-reference/weave#group-management) API.

</Callout>

Once the node is registered you can use it on [Actions](/docs/main/build/actions) or
[Plugins](/docs/main/build/plugins) or even other [Nodes](/docs/main/build/nodes).
