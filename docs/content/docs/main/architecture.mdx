This page provides a detailed overview of the Weave.js architecture, including its design principles, key features, and underlying technologies.

## Design principles

Weave.js is designed to help developers build visual collaborative UI applications,
tools that are often complex by nature, involving canvas rendering, rich interactions, and
dynamic real-time state management. To manage all this complexity, Weave.js it is built on four key principles:

- **Simple and opinionated:** A declarative API and strong defaults reduce boilerplate code and guide you toward scalable patterns—so you can focus on building features, not fighting complexity.

- **Composable:** High-level [building blocks](/docs/main/build) that are modular and designed for composition, enabling clear separation of rendering, state, and interactions.

- **Extendable:** A plugin-based architecture makes nearly every part of Weave.js customizable, from canvas behavior to rendering, without touching the core.

- **UI framework agnostic:** Works with any framework. Use React, Vue, or others; Weave.js handles the collaborative layer, while you own the UI.

## Key features

These are the functional domains that Weave.js is built to support out of the box:

### Canvas rendering

Weave.js simplifies [canvas](/docs/main/glossary#canvas) rendering logic and interactions and provides a custom rendering lifecycle.
It introduces the [Node](/docs/main/build/nodes) and [Plugin](/docs/main/build/plugins) abstractions to give you a unified, extensible way to manage canvas logic.

To help you get started quickly, Weave.js includes a set of base nodes and plugins that cover common use cases.

### Real-time state synchronization

Weave.js provides everything you need to enable real-time collaboration across different transport layers.
It introduces the [Store](/docs/main/build/stores) abstraction for managing shared state.

To help you get started without delay, Weave.js includes a set of base stores.

### Users interactions

Weave.js offers an API for building custom user interactions.
By separating rendering from interaction logic, it gives you greater control over application behavior, making features like undo/redo easier to implement without affecting the rendering process.

The [Action](/docs/main/build/actions) abstraction provides a unified API for managing user interactions. To accelerate development, Weave.js also includes a set of base actions.

## Technologies behind Weave.js

Internally, Weave.js profusely uses the following open-source libraries:

### Konva.js

We use [Konva.js](https://konvajs.org/docs/overview.html) to manage and simplify the HTML5 canvas rendering. 
Its high-level abstraction over the HTML5 canvas API simplifies the process of creating and manipulating canvas primitives
—the basic building blocks for any canvas-based application.

### React Reconciler

We use a custom [React Reconciler](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-reconciler) to bridge React’s component model state for the Konva rendering process. 
This integration allows developers to define nodes as Classes with specific life-cycle while Weave.js internally handles the rest.
This way we benefit from efficient, incremental updates and the internal React's renderer life-cycle optimizations without the need to know React declaratively way (JSX).

### Yjs

Real-time collaboration is part of our core.
To handle all the heavy lifting about the shared-state, network, and client management, Weave.js uses [Yjs](https://yjs.dev), a [CRDT](/docs/main/glossary#crdt)-based framework that ensures consistency across distributed clients.

It handles network conflicts automatically, guarantees that all users stay in sync, even during offline
or concurrent edits and support awareness events sharing. Also allows to persist the shared-state in an
agnostic and custom way.

### SyncedStore

We use [SyncedStore](https://syncedstore.org/docs), an API for Yjs, to provide a developer-friendly
abstraction layer. SyncedStore offers a simple, reactive API that makes working with shared-state feel
like building a regular single-user app—while seamlessly handling all the multiplayer complexity under the hood.
