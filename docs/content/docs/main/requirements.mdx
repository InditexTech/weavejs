description: Required system dependencies and versions
---

Before you begin, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

- macOS, Windows (WSL), or Linux.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/es/download) `18.18.0` or later.

<Callout title="UI agnostic" type="info">
  Install Weave.js on top of any UI framework, such as Next.js, React, Angular,
  or Vue. As Weave.js is UI agnostic.
</Callout>

## Peer dependencies

- [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) `18.2.0` or less than `19.x`.

<Callout title="Why React is a requirement?" type="warning">
  Weave.js uses a custom React Reconciler internally, so React must be installed as a peer dependency.
  Only specific React versions within the supported range are compatible.
</Callout>

Although not required, some basic knowledge of [Konva.js](https://konvajs.org/docs/overview.html)
can be helpful for further customizations.
