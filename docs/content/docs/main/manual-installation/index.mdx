## Introduction

Lets integrate Weave.js on a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) application manually.

<Callout title="Why Next.js?" type="note">
  The usage of Next.js on the quickstart allow us to have the frontend and backend
  on the same artifact, thus simplifies the quickstart process. Also is one of the most understand
  frameworks built on top of React.

For a detailed code on how to setup Weave.js on separated artifacts, check our
showcase artifacts implementations repositories: [Backend](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs-backend)
and [Frontend](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs-frontend)

</Callout>

<Callout title="Next.js version used">
  Take into consideration that we will use Next.js version 14, as today Weave.js
  is not compatible with React 19, which is the version of React that ships with the
  latest version (v15 when writing this document) of Next.js.

</Callout>

## Setup

In order to have a Weave.js project running, we need to fully complete this
steps:

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">
 
### Install Next.js

Lets start our journey by creating a new Next.js application, just run the
following command - when prompted, accept all the default values:

```shell
npx create-next-app@next-14
```

When finished, navigate to the project folder and start the development server
by running the following command:

```shell
npm run dev
```

You should be able now to open your Next.js base app on a browser by navigating
to http://localhost:3000.

<Callout title="Failed to load images" type="warn">
  You will notice that some images will fail to load, this is because Next.js
  images URLs changed and are not available. To fix this is up to Next.js maintainers
  and not us, we'll ignore it for now as it doesn't affect Us.

</Callout>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>
 
### Install Weave.js SDK

Located on your root project folder, install the **Weave.js** SDK by
executing the following command:

```shell
npm install @inditextech/weave-sdk @inditextech/weave-types
```

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>
 
### Setup the Backend side

Now that the main dependencies are installed, lets first work with the backend side.

In this step we'll [setup the Backend side](/docs/main/manual-installation/backend) of the application.

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>
 
### Setup the Frontend side

After the backend side is setup, the application also needs a frontend side where
users will visually collaborate.

In this step we'll [setup the Frontend side](/docs/main/manual-installation/frontend) of the application.

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>
 
### Run the project

If your completed all the previous steps, you should have a working project, so lets
run the project with the following command:

```shell
npm run dev
```

On a browser navigate to http://localhost:3000, remember, this is the **Enter Room
page**. On it, just type a _room name_ and your _username_, then click on the `Enter`
button to join the room.

The application should navigate to http://localhost:3000/room/{roomName}, where
`{roomName}` is the name of the room you entered. On the **Room page**, you first should
notice a loader, once loaded you should be able to:

- See the collaborative canvas.
- Handle the canvas zoom and pan.
- Create a simple node like a xref:api-reference:sdk/nodes/rectangle.adoc[Rectangle] on it.

Try to open another tab with other _username_ on the same _room name_, you should be
able to see the changes made by the other user.

Congratulations! You have a working Weave.js application.

## Next steps

Now that you've completed the quickstart, you're ready to dive deeper into Weave.js and unlock its
full potential. Here are some of our recommended next steps:

### Explore the Architecture

To better understand Weave.js xref:architecture:index.adoc[architecture] and to learn
how to build modular and interactive tools, learn how Weave.js is structured under
the hood and get familiar with core concepts like:

- xref:architecture:nodes.adoc[Nodes],
- xref:architecture:plugins.adoc[Plugins],
- and xref:architecture:actions.adoc[Actions].

### Review the API Reference

Dive into the xref:api-reference:index.adoc[API reference] to explore all available methods, utilities,
and configuration options. This is your go-to resource as you start building more advanced features.
