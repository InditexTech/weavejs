description: Integrate Weave.js to a new or existing Next.js project

import { Step, Steps } from "fumadocs-ui/components/steps";

In this guide, we will manually integrate Weave.js into a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) application.

<Callout title="Why Next.js?" type="note">

Next.js is used in this quickstart to simplify the process by combining the frontend and backend into a single artifact.
It's a widely adopted framework built on React.

For instructions on setting up Weave.js with separate artifacts, refer to our showcase implementations:

- [Backend](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs-backend)
- [Frontend](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs-frontend)

</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you meet the [requirements](/docs/main/requirements).

<Callout title="Next.js version used" type="info">
  Weave.js is not compatible with React 19, which is included in Next.js 15. For
  this reason, we will use **Next.js 14**.
</Callout>

### Set up your project

To have a Weave.js project running, follow these steps:

---

#### Install Next.js

If you don't have a Next.js 14 project already, start by creating a new one.
Run the following command, and when prompted, accept all the default values:

```shell
npx create-next-app@next-14
```

When finished, navigate to the project folder and start the development server by running the following command:

```shell
npm run dev
```

You should be able now to open your Next.js base app on a browser by navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

<Callout title="Failed to load images" type="warn">
  Some images in the default Next.js template may not load correctly. You can
  safely ignore this issue since it is specific to the template and does not
  impact the functionality of Weave.js.
</Callout>

---

#### Install Weave.js SDK

Located on your root project folder, install the **Weave.js SDK** by
executing the following command:

```shell
npm install @inditextech/weave-sdk
```

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>
 
### Set up the backend

Follow the steps to [set up the backend](/docs/main/manual-installation/backend) of the application.

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>
 
### Set up the frontend

Follow the steps to [set up the frontend](/docs/main/manual-installation/frontend) of the application.

</div>

<div className='[&_h3]:fd-step'>
 
### Run the project

If you have completed all the previous steps, you should have a working project.

To run the project, use the following command:

```shell
npm run dev
```

On a browser navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

You will see the **Enter Room** page:

<div className="flex justify-center items-center *:max-w-[600px] bg-gradient-to-br from-fd-primary/10 rounded-xl border">
  ![Enter room page](/images/enter-room-manual.png)
</div>

On it, enter a _room name_ and your _username_, then click on the **ENTER THE ROOM** button.

Once the **Room** loads, you will be able to:

<div className="flex justify-center items-center *:max-w-[600px] bg-gradient-to-br from-fd-primary/10 rounded-xl border">
  ![Room page](/images/room.png)
</div>

- View the collaborative canvas.
- Zoom and pan the canvas.
- Create a simple node, such as a [Rectangle](/docs/main/build/nodes/rectangle).

Next, try opening another tab with a different username and the same room name and make some changes.
In the first tab, you should see the changes made by this new user.

Congratulations! You have a working Weave.js application.

## Next steps

Now that you've completed the quickstart, you're ready to dive deeper into Weave.js and unlock its full potential. Here are some of our recommended next steps:

### Explore the building blocks

To learn how to build modular and interactive tools, explore how Weave.js is structured under the hood and get familiar with core concepts like:

- [Nodes](/docs/main/build/nodes)
- [Plugins](/docs/main/build/plugins)
- [Actions](/docs/main/build/actions)

### Review the API Reference

Dive into [API reference](/docs/sdk) to explore all available methods, utilities, and configuration options.
This is your go-to resource as you start building more advanced features.
