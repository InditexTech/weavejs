title: Set up the backend
description: Learn how to set up the backend of a Weave.js app on Next.js
---

In this guide, you will learn how to set up the backend infrastructure for a collaborative application using Weave.js. 

To make the backend functional, we need to set up a Next.js
[custom server](https://nextjs.org/docs/14/pages/building-your-application/configuring/custom-server)
to later integrate Weave.js Websockets store. 

The store will handle the shared-state management, client networking, persistence, and awareness events.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have completed the [manual installation](/docs/main/manual-installation) guide up to the *"Set up the backend project"* step.

## Step by step

To set up Weave.js backend over our Next.js project (on a single artifact), follow these steps:

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">
 
### Install the Weave.js backend dependencies

First, let's install the **Weave.js** websocket store dependencies. 

On your root project folder, execute the following command:

```shell
npm install ws @inditextech/weave-store-websockets
```

</div>

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">
 
### Set up the Next.js custom server

To have a frontend and backend on the same artifact on top of Next.js we need to implement 
a [custom server](https://nextjs.org/docs/14/pages/building-your-application/configuring/custom-server)
on Next.js, and later on, include the necessary Weave.js backend logic.

<Callout title="Not recommended for production" type="warn">
  For production environments, you should consider using a separate backend server to handle the Weave.js backend logic.

For more details, refer to the [backend showcase implementation](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs-backend).
</Callout>

#### Dependencies installation

To start, install the necessary dependencies for the custom server with the following commands:

- Dependencies needed on runtime:

```shell
npm install cross-env express
```

- Dependencies only needed on the local development environment or build time:

```shell
npm install -D ts-node nodemon @types/express
```

#### TypeScript configuration

<Callout title="Nodemon" type="note">
This section uses [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon), a tool that helps to automatically start the underlying Node.js application when a file changes.
</Callout>

Then, set up the TypeScript configuration for the server part:

- Create a `tsconfig.server.json` file on the root of your project with the following content:

  <include lang="json" meta='title="tsconfig.server.json"'>
    ../../examples/manual-installation/tsconfig.server.json
  </include>

- Set up the transpilation of the server files from TypeScript to JavaScript. Create a `nodemon.json` file on the root of your project with the following content:

  <include lang="json" meta='title="nodemon.json"'>
    ../../examples/manual-installation/nodemon.json
  </include>

#### Custom server logic

<Callout title="Express" type="note">
  This section uses [Express](https://expressjs.com), a web framework for Node.js, as the underlying server for the custom server.
</Callout>

Define the custom server logic by creating a file named `server.ts` on the root of your project with the following content:

<include lang="ts" meta='title="server.ts"'>
  ../../examples/manual-installation/server.ts
</include>

#### Custom server tooling

To properly use the custom server both locally and during the build process, we need to customize the dependent scripts in your `package.json`: specifically the `dev`, `build`, and `start` scripts.

Change the scripts definitions with the following content:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "dev": "next dev --turbo", // [!code --]
    "dev": "nodemon", // [!code ++]
    "build": "next build", // [!code --]
    "build": "next build && tsc --project tsconfig.server.json", // [!code ++]
    "start": "next start", // [!code --]
    "start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production node dist/server.js" // [!code ++]
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

Finally, test that the Next.js project keeps starting with the new custom server configuration. 

On the project root folder, run the following command:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` on a browser.
You should still see the Next.js default application running and the console should have no errors at all.

### Integrate Weave.js into the backend

Now that the Next.js custom server is completely set up, let's add the necessary Weave.js backend logic. For that, we will use the xref:api-reference:stores/websockets/index.adoc[Websockets store] library: (`@inditextech/weave-store-websockets`). 

We need to:

- Define how to handle the persistence of the shared-state.
- Instantiate the [WeaveWebsocketsServer](/docs/store-websockets/api-reference/server/weave-websockets-server) class from the library `@inditextech/weave-store-websockets` and configure it.

#### Set up the shared-state persistence handlers

In this step, we will define the persistence logic for the shared-state.
In this case, we use the file system as our persistence layer.

Create a `persistence.ts` file on the project root and set its content to:

<include lang="ts" meta='title="persistence.ts"'>
  ../../examples/manual-installation/persistence.ts
</include>

File explanation:

- **`(1)`**: Import necessary Node.js dependencies to handle the file system.
- **`(2)`**: `fetchRoom` function fetches a previously saved shared-state of a room by its ID from the file system.
- **`(3)`**: `persistRoom` function persist the shared-state of a room by its ID onto the file system.

#### Set up the Weave.js Websockets store

Finally, set up the Weave.js store handler.
In this case, we use the Websockets transport.

On the custom server file `server.ts`, add the necessary logic to use the `@inditextech/weave-store-websockets` store handler. 

You can replace the contents of `server.ts` with this content:

<include lang="ts" meta='title="server.ts"'>
  ../../examples/manual-installation/server.mod-1.ts
</include>

Changes explanation:

- **`(1)`**: Import **Weave.js** Websockets store dependency.
- **`(2)`**: Import persistence handlers previously defined.
- **`(3)`**: Define a regex to identify the **Weave.js** Websockets connection URI.
- **`(4)`**: Extract the underlying HTTP server.
- **`(5)`**: Define the configuration for the [WeaveWebsocketsServer](/docs/store-websockets/api-reference/server/weave-websockets-server) class.
- **`(6)`**: Define the property `performUpgrade`, this indicates which URIs are valid for the Websocket upgrade protocol
  (upgrade from HTTP to WEBSOCKETS)
- **`(7)`**: Define the property `extractRoomId`, this indicates how to extract the room ID from the Websocket connection URI.
- **`(8)`**: Use the previous `fetchRoom` function for persistence management.
- **`(9)`**: Use the previous `persistRoom` function for persistence management.
- **`(10)`**: Instantiate the [WeaveWebsocketsServer](/docs/store-websockets/api-reference/server/weave-websockets-server) class.
- **`(11)`**: Attach the **Weave.js** Websockets server to the HTTP server.

### Run the project

Finally, test that the project keeps starting with the changes made to the custom server.

On the project root folder, run the following command:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` on a browser.

You should still see the Next.js default application running and the console should have no errors at all.

### Next steps

Let's now [set up the frontend](/docs/main/manual-installation/frontend) of the application.
