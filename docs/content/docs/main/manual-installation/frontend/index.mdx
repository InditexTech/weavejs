description: Learn how to set up the frontend of a Weave.js app on Next.js
---

In this guide, you will learn how to set up the frontend of a collaborative application using Weave.js and Next.js.

To build the collaborative canvas interface, you will create two pages:

- **Enter room page:** Let users indicate the room name or ID and a username to join a collaboration room.
- **Room page:** Handles the UI for the collaboration room after a user joins.

<Callout title="Opinionated tools" type="note">
This guide uses some opinionated tools and libraries (like shadcn/ui for UI components) to demonstrate the integration.
Adapt or replace these tools to match your project's needs and preferences.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have completed the [backend installation](/docs/main/manual-installation/backend) guide.

## Step by step

To set up Weave.js frontend over our Next.js project (on a single artifact), follow these steps:

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Install the Weave.js frontend dependencies

From the project root folder, install the **Weave.js** frontend dependencies:

```shell
npm install @inditextech/weave-react
```

This example uses the Weave.js React wrapper.

</div>

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Install the additional frontend dependencies

From the project root, install supporting frontend libraries:

```shell
npm install boring-avatars class-variance-authority clsx @hookform/resolvers lucide-react react-hook-form tailwindcss-animate tailwind-merge @tanstack/react-query zod
```

These packages provide auxiliary functionality such as:

* **Form handling:** `react-hook-form`, `@hookform/resolvers`, `zod`

* **UI utilities:** `clsx`, `class-variance-authority`, `tailwind-merge`, `tailwindcss-animate`

* **Icons and avatars:** `lucide-react`, `boring-avatars`

* **State management:** `@tanstack/react-query`

</div>

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Set up a global state store for the UI

Create a global state store to handle the UI state.
This store manages the current user, room ID, and UI visibility state across the application.
Use
[Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction) for this.

- Install the [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction) dependency:

  ```shell
  npm install zustand
  ```

- Create a `store/store.ts` file in the project root folder and set its content to:

  <include lang="ts" meta='title="store/store.ts"'>
    ../../../../../manual-installation/store/store.ts
  </include>

</div>

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Configure utility functions

Create a `lib/utils.ts` file in the project root folder to provide utility functions used throughout the UI components.

Create the file with the following content:

<include lang="ts" meta='title="lib/utils.ts"'>
  ../../../../../manual-installation/lib/utils.ts
</include>

</div>

This file includes:

- **`cn` function:** Merges Tailwind CSS class names with proper conflict resolution using `clsx` and `tailwind-merge`. This ensures that when you combine multiple class strings, conflicting Tailwind utilities are resolved correctly (e.g., `p-4` and `p-2` will result in `p-2`).

- **`getContrastTextColor` function:** Determines whether white or black text provides better contrast against a given hex color background. It calculates the relative luminance of the color using the W3C standard formula and returns the appropriate text color for readability.

- **`stringToColor` function:** Generates a consistent hex color from any string input using a hash function. This is useful for creating deterministic color assignments (like avatar backgrounds) based on user names or other identifiers.


<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Set up the Enter Room page

With the global state store in place, create the [Enter Room page](/docs/main/manual-installation/frontend/enter-room-page).

</div>

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Set up the Room page

Now that the Enter Room page is set up, create the [Room page](/docs/main/manual-installation/frontend/room-page).

</div>

</div>

## Next steps

Finally, [run the project](/docs/main/manual-installation#run-the-project).
