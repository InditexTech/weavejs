description: Learn how to set up the frontend of a Weave.js app on Next.js
---

In this guide, you will learn how to set up the frontend of a collaborative application using Weave.js and Next.js.

To build the collaborative canvas interface, you will create two pages:

- **Enter room page:** Let users indicate the room name or ID and a username to join a collaboration room.
- **Room page:** Handles the UI for the collaboration room after a user joins.

<Callout title="Opinionated tools" type="note">
This guide uses some opinionated tools and libraries (like shadcn/ui for UI components) to demonstrate the integration.
Adapt or replace these tools tomatch your project's needs and preferences.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have completed the [backend installation](/docs/main/manual-installation/backend) guide.

## Step by step

To set up Weave.js frontend over our Next.js project (on a single artifact), follow these steps:

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Install the Weave.js frontend dependencies

From the project root folder, install the **Weave.js** frontend dependencies:

```shell
npm install @inditextech/weave-react
```

This example uses the Weave.js React wrapper.

</div>

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Install frontend dependencies

Located on your project folder, install the frontend dependencies:

```shell
npm install boring-avatars lucide-react @tanstack/react-query
```

</div>

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Set up a global state store for the UI

Start by creating a global state store to handle the UI state.
This store manages the current user, room ID, and UI visibility state across the application.
Use
[Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction) for this.

- First, install the [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction) dependency:

  ```shell
  npm install zustand
  ```

- Create a `store/store.ts` file in the root folder of your project and set its content to:

  <include lang="ts" meta='title="store/store.ts"'>
    ../../../../../manual-installation/store/store.ts
  </include>

</div>

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Set up the Enter Room page

With the global state store in place, create the [Enter Room page](/docs/main/manual-installation/frontend/enter-room-page).

</div>

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

### Set up the Room page

Now that the Enter Room page is set up, create the [Room page](/docs/main/manual-installation/frontend/room-page).

</div>

</div>

## Next steps

Finally, [run the project](/docs/main/manual-installation#run-the-project).
