description: Learn how to set up the frontend of a Weave.js app on Next.js
---

In this guide, you will learn how to set up the frontend of a collaborative application using Weave.js and Next.js.

The minimal setup involves two pages:

- One that allows users to indicate the room name or ID and a username to join a collaboration room.
  Let's call this page the **Enter Room page** from now on.
- A second page that handles the UI for the collaboration room once the user has joined.
  Let's call this page the **Room page** from now on.

<Callout title="Opinionated tools" type="note">
  We will use some opinionated tools and libraries (like shadcn/ui for UI
  components) to demonstrate the integration. Feel free to adapt and use
  alternatives that better match your project's needs and preferences.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have completed the [backend installation](/docs/main/manual-installation/backend) guide.

## Step by step

To set up Weave.js frontend over our Next.js project (on a single artifact), follow these steps:

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">
 
### Install the Weave.js frontend dependencies

Located on your project folder, install the **Weave.js** frontend dependencies:

```shell
npm install @inditextech/weave-react
```

In this case we're using the Weave.js React wrapper.

</div>

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">
 
### Install frontend dependencies

Located on your project folder, install the frontend dependencies:

```shell
npm install boring-avatars lucide-react @tanstack/react-query
```

</div>

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">
 
### Set up a global state store for the UI

Let's start by creating a global state store to handle the UI state. We will use
[Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction) for this.

- First, install the [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction) dependency:

  ```shell
  npm install zustand
  ```

- Create a `store/store.ts` file on the root folder of your project and set its content to:

  <include lang="ts" meta='title="store/store.ts"'>
    ../../../../../manual-installation/store/store.ts
  </include>

</div>

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">
 
### Set up the Enter Room page

With the global state store in place, create the [Enter Room page](/docs/main/manual-installation/frontend/enter-room-page).

</div>

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">
 
### Set up the Room page

Now that the Enter Room page is set up, create the [Room page](/docs/main/manual-installation/frontend/room-page).

</div>

</div>

## Next steps

Let's now [run the project](/docs/main/manual-installation#run-the-project).
