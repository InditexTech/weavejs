## Introduction

The minimal setup for a collaborative applications needs to define two pages:

- One that allow to indicate the room name or ID and username to use to join a collaboration room.
  Lets call this page from now on the **Enter Room page**.
- A second one that will handle the UI for the collaboration room once joined.
  Lets call this page from now on the **Room page**.

## Frontend setup

To setup Weave.js frontend over our Next.js project (on a single artifact), we need
to fully complete this steps:

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">
 
### Install the Weave.js frontend dependencies

Located on your project folder, let's now install the **Weave.js** frontend dependencies:

```shell
npm install boring-avatars lucide-react @inditextech/weave-react
```

</div>

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">
 
### Setup a global state store for the UI

Let's start by creating a global state store to handle the UI state, we will use
[Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction) for this.

```shell
npm install boring-avatars lucide-react @inditextech/weave-react
```

- First install the [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction) dependency:

  ```shell
  npm install zustand
  ```

- Create a `store/store.ts` file on the `src` folder of your project and set it's
  content to this:

  <include lang="ts" meta='title="store/store.ts"'>
    ../../../examples/manual-installation/store/store.ts
  </include>

</div>

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">
 
### Setup the Enter Room page

Now we have a working global state store for the UI, let's setup the
[Enter Room page](/docs/main/manual-installation/frontend/enter-room-page).

</div>

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">
 
### Setup the Room page

Now that we have setup the Enter Room page, let's setup the
[Room page](/docs/main/manual-installation/frontend/room-page).

</div>

</div>

### Next steps

Let's now [run the project](/docs/main/manual-installation#run-the-project).
