<Callout title="UI agnostic" type="note">
  You can install Weave.js on top of any UI framework, such as Next.js, React,
  Angular, or Vue. As Weave.js is UI agnostic.
</Callout>

Before you begin, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

- macOS, Windows (WSL), or Linux.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/es/download) `18.18.0` or later.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) `18.2.0` or less than `19.x`.

<Callout title="React dependency">
  React is used for the React Reconciler, which is a low-level dependency of
  Weave.js. You can use Weave.js with any UI framework, such as Next.js,
  Angular, or Vue.

In the future we plan to deliver a version to support React 19.

</Callout>
