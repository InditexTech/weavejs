## Canvas

The [HTML5 Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/canvas)
is a powerful web API that provides a drawing surface within the browser. It allows
developers to render 2D graphics, such as shapes, images, animations, and visual interfaces, using JavaScript.

Unlike HTML elements, canvas content is pixel-based and doesn't retain a DOM structure,
making it ideal for high-performance, dynamic visuals like games, design tools,
and collaborative drawing apps—like those built with Weave.js.

## CRDT

A CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) is a data structure designed to
automatically resolve conflicts in distributed systems, especially in real-time
collaborative applications. It allows multiple users to update shared data
simultaneously, and guarantees that all changes will merge consistently across
devices—without requiring a central server or manual conflict resolution.

CRDTs are the foundation of real-time sync in Weave.js (via [Yjs](https://yjs.dev)),
making collaboration smooth, reliable, and resilient—even under network latency or
disconnection.
