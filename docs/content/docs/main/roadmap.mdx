title: Roadmap
description: What are we cooking?
---

This roadmap focuses on broadening:

1. Server frameworks compatibility,
2. Expanding store options,
3. Introducing new creative and collaborative tools, and
4. Enhancing functionality through new plugins.

All while maintaining Weave.js’s core principles: Simple, Composable, and Extendable.

## Focus areas

### 1. Server-side integrations

**Goal**: Broaden backend server frameworks integration options for Weave.js users.

- **Koa Support**: Implement a [Koa.js](https://koajs.com/) compatible server integration for our stores.
- **Fastify Support**: Implement a [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) compatible server integration for our stores.
- **NestJS Support**: Implement a [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) compatible server integration for our stores.

### 2. Frontend integrations

**Goal**: Broaden frontend frameworks integration options for Weave.js users.

- **Vue.js bindings**: starter kit or bindings for [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).
- **Svelte bindings**: starter kit or bindings for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

### 3. Stores

**Goal**: Offer more stores options with transports for other cloud providers.

- **AWS SNS store**: Implement store that uses as transport AWS SNS.
- **Google Cloud Pub/Sub store**: Implement store that uses as transport Google Cloud Pub/Sub.

### 4. Tools

**Goal**: Expand canvas tooling to cover broader use cases.

- **Connector tool**: specialized for drawing linked arrows between nodes (great for
  flowcharts).
- **Sticky Notes tool**: create "sticky note" styled text nodes with distinct look and
  behavior.

### 5. Plugins

**Goal**: Strengthen collaboration and interaction capabilities.

- **Minimap plugin**: show a small-scale overview of the entire canvas with viewport
  tracking.
- **Comment plugin**: allow users to attach comments to nodes, supporting asynchronous
  collaboration.
- **Smart Alignment Guides plugin**: show alignment hints (showcasing distance) dynamically
  as users drag or resize nodes (like [Figma’s](https://www.figma.com/) smart guides).
- **Awareness plugin**: show when someone else is editing a specific node or the actions
  is taking.

### 6. UX/UI

**Goal**: Improve the usage of the library on desktop and mobile platforms through improvements.

- **Mobile-Friendly canvas tools**: add touch gesture optimizations (multi-touch
  zoom, pan, and selection).

### 7. Documentation

**Goal**: Lower entry barriers and speed up adoption.

- **Quickstart**: new server-side and frontend quickstart (Koa, Fastify, NestJS, Vue.js & Svelte).
- **Advanced tutorials**: custom node creation or building a custom tool or plugin.
- **Architecture deep-dives**: Detailed docs about lifecycle, rendering and
  synchronization.

## Timeline proposal

Based on the current team size and velocity, we propose the following timeline:

| Quarter | Focus Area                                               |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Q3 2025 | Mobile gesture support improvements, Smart Guides Plugin |
| Q4 2025 | Connector Tool, Sticky Notes Tool                        |
| Q1 2026 | Awareness enhancement, Comment plugin, Minimap Plugin    |
| Q2 2026 | Other cloud providers stores                             |
| Q3 2026 | Koa server, Fastify server, NestJS server                |
| Q4 2026 | Bindings kit for Vue, Bindings for Svelte                |
