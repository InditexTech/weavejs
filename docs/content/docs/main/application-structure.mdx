A standard **Weave.js** project follows a frontend-backend architecture designed to support real-time collaboration, efficient state synchronization, and persistent data storage.

<Callout title="In production..." type="warn">
  For production, we recommend deploying the frontend and backend separately.
  However, they can also run together in a single project, as shown in the  [Manual installation](/docs/main/manual-installation) guide using Next.js.
</Callout>

## Frontend artifact

The frontend is usually built with a modern web framework like React or Vue.
Weave.js provides an SDK and optional integration libraries, like our React helper library, to facilitate the creation of collaborative visual interfaces.

<Callout title="Example" type="note">
See the [weavejs-frontend](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs-frontend) repository for a reference implementation.
</Callout>

On the frontend, Weave.js handles:

- **Canvas rendering:** Handles all the canvas rendering and life-cycle via Konva.js elements and the React Reconciler.
- **Real-time state synchronization:** Provides clients to connect to the backend, allowing them to manage the real-time collaboration, via Yjs and SyncedStore.
- **User interaction:** Enables custom drawing nodes, actions, or plugins for the UI logic via our plugin system.

Weave.js exposes a set of core abstractions to simplify and standardize development:

* [Nodes](/docs/main/build/nodes):  Core building blocks of the collaborative interface: lines, rectangles, text, images, frames... Use the provided ones or build your own.

* [Plugins](/docs/main/build/plugins): Extend and enhance the functionality of Weave.js. 

* [Actions](/docs/main/build/actions): Handle user interactions and user-driven changes. 


## Backend artifact

The backend is usually built using Node.js on top of a server framework like Express, Koa, etc. 
Weave.js provides the [Store](/docs/main/build/store) abstraction to manage the shared application state and enable collaborative editing.

<Callout title="Example" type="note">
See the [weavejs-backend](https://github.com/InditexTech/weavejs-backend) repository for a reference implementation.
</Callout>

On the backend, Weave.js handles:

* **State persistence and retrieval:** [Stores](/docs/main/build/stores) exposes an API for loading and saving shared state, enabling custom storage backends such as a file system, blob storage, or a cloud service.
  In the reference implementation, shared state binary files are persisted and retrieved using [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs).

* **Real-time state transport**: Stores also handle real-time synchronization of the shared state across clients. Weave.js includes built-in support for WebSockets and Azure Web PubSub, and also lets you implement custom stores with your own transport layer (e.g. AWS AppSync).

* **Awareness events (optional)**: Weave.js supports optional awareness events—such as user join/leave events or cursor position—using Yjs's [awareness](https://docs.yjs.dev/getting-started/adding-awareness) mechanism. This ephemeral data is shared only between active clients (not persisted) and is supported out of the box by all built-in stores. Awareness can enhance collaboration but should be used thoughtfully to avoid distractions.
