description: Getting started with Weave.js Standalone store
---

The Standalone Store is a store for Weave.js that directly render a Room passed to the store.
Super useful when exporting server-side (mainly used this way), just pass the data of the room
to export, render it, and then use the exporting utilities to generate the image of the room.

## Usage

<div className="fd-steps">

<div className="[&_h3]:fd-step">

Just use the store on a Weave instance on the server, to render it.

```ts
import { WeaveStoreStandalone } from "@inditextech/weave-store-standalone/server";

const roomData = "MyRoomBinaryData";

const store = new WeaveStoreStandalone(
  {
    roomData,
  },
  {
    getUser: () => {
      return {
        id: "user-dummy",
        name: "User Dummy",
        email: "user@mail.com",
      };
    },
  }
);
```

Explanation:

- **`(1)`**: Import the Weave.js store dependencies.
- **`(2)`**: Define the room data to load (normally a Yjs binary)
- **`(3)`**: Instantiate the `WeaveStoreStandalone` class.
