= Enter Room page

On this guide we build the **Enter Room** page. This page will allow an user to define
which room we wants to join and with what username it wants to join it. Lets build it
step by step.

== Overview

To setup the **Enter Room** page on the _Next.js_ project, we need to fully complete
this checklist:

* [ ] Define the page component.
* [ ] Install the UI building block components.
* [ ] Define the base styles.
* [ ] Setup the `Home` React component.
* [ ] Setup the `LoginForm` React component.

== Step 4.3.1. Define the page component

Replace the contents of the file `app/page.tsx` with the following content:

[source,typescript]
----
include::ROOT:example$app/page.tsx[]
----

== Step 4.3.2. Install the UI building block components

Lets now setup the necessary https://ui.shadcn.com/docs[Shadcn/UI] components for the `Enter Room` page.

We'll be using the link:https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli[Shadcn/UI CLI] to install the UI components. Accept
all the defaults from the CLI options.

. First lets install the https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/form[Form] component
+
[source,typescript]
----
npx shadcn@latest add form
----
+
. Then install the https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/input[Input] component
+
[source,typescript]
----
npx shadcn@latest add input
----

== Step 4.3.3. Define the base styles

Now let's tune up a little bit the styling of the `Enter Room` page.

. Replace the `@layer base` directive configuration on the `app/globals.css` file with this:
+
[source,css]
----
include::ROOT:example$app/globals.css[]
----

== Step 4.3.4. Setup the page React component

Lets first setup a folder to put all our components:

. First create a `components` folder on the root of the project.
. Then create a `home` folder on the `components` folder.

=== Home

To setup the `Home` React component, create a file named: `home.tsx` inside the `components/home`
folder with the following content:

[source,typescript]
----
include::ROOT:example$components/home/home.tsx[]
----

=== LoginForm

To setup the `LoginForm` React component, create a file named: `login-form.tsx` inside the `components/home`
folder with the following content:

[source,typescript]
----
include::ROOT:example$components/home/login-form.tsx[]
----

'''

Now that we have finished the setup of the **Enter Room** page, lets try and run the project, run the 
following command:

[source,shell]
----
npm run dev
----

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 on a browser, you should see the following:

== Next Steps

Let's now setup the xref:ROOT:quickstart.frontend.room.adoc[Room page] of the Quickstart application.
