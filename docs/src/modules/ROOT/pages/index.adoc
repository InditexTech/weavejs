= Streamlined Visual Collaborative Web Applications

**Weave.js** is a modular JavaScript library that streamlines the development of visual collaborative
web applications built with an HTML5 canvas. Designed with a robust plugin architecture, **Weave.js** enables
developers to extend functionality seamlessly, supporting a wide range of custom nodes, actions and plugins.

It offers a clean and efficient API for:

- Rendering interactive nodes or graphics elements
- Managing layered content
- Handling user input
- Facilitating real-time multi-user collaboration.

Ideal for building applications such as diagram editors, whiteboards, and design platforms, **Weave.js**
provides the flexibility and scalability needed for modern, canvas-based collaborative tools.
