= Architecture

**Weave.js** is designed to help developers build visual collaborative UI applications, 
tools that are often complex by nature, involving canvas rendering, rich interactions, and
dynamic real-time state management. To manage all this complexity, **Weave.js** is built
around three core principles:

* **Simple**: simplicity is at the heart of **Weave.js**. From its declarative API to its
plugin-friendly design, every part of the library is designed to reduce boilerplate
and make development a breeze. Whether you're rendering shapes or handling user interactions,
the goal is to keep things easy to reason about. _Focus on building features, not fighting
complexity_.
* **Composable**: building complex UI interfaces requires a system that scales well.
In **Weave.js**, everything is designed with composition in mind. Our building blocks can be
combined, even among them, to create more sophisticated behaviors. _This approach encourages
reusability, modularity, and a clear separation of concerns_.
* **Extendable**: no two collaborative tools are the same, and **Weave.js** embraces that
by being deeply extendable. This makes **Weave.js** adaptable to a wide range of use cases,
from whiteboards to diagramming tools to visual design platforms. _You can customize nearly
every aspect, from the canvas behavior, interaction models to rendering logic, without touching
the core_.

== Building blocks

A building block is typically a simple, well-defined unit—like a shape, a UI component, or a
plugin—that does one thing well. You can mix and match these blocks to assemble more advanced
features or entire applications. **Weave.js** provides a set of well-defined building blocks:

=== Nodes

Are the fundamental visual building blocks in **Weave.js**. They are primarily based on Konva.js
primitives (shapes and groups) and represent everything rendered on the canvas.

=== Plugins

Plugins extend and enhance **Weave.js's** core functionality. Whether it's selection handling,
canvas panning, zooming, or custom behaviors, plugins allow you to modular add or override features
without cluttering the core logic.

=== Actions

Actions are how user interactions are interpreted and executed within **Weave.js**. From adding
new Nodes to the canvas to triggering selection or transformation, Actions provide a clean and
consistent way to handle event-driven logic.

.For example, in **Weave.js**
====
* A **Node** like a rectangle or text element is a _building block of the visual canvas_.
* A **Plugin** that handles zooming is a _building block for interaction logic_.
* An **Action** to add a Node to the canvas is a _building block for user workflows_.

Just like LEGO pieces, these building blocks are designed to fit together, letting developers
construct complex behavior without starting from scratch each time.
