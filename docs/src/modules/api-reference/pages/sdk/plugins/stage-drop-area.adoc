= WeaveStageDropAreaPlugin

The **WeaveStageDropAreaPlugin** plugin enables drag-and-drop support on the canvas,
allowing users to drop elements—such as shapes, files, or custom components—directly
onto the Stage. It captures drop events, calculates drop positions, and can trigger
custom Actions or workflows based on the dropped content.

This plugin is ideal for building intuitive drag-to-create interfaces, asset import
features, or external integrations (e.g., dropping images or nodes from a sidebar).
It integrates smoothly with Weave.js's action system for precise and flexible drop
handling.

  doUploadFile?: WeaveStageDropUploadFileCallback; // <2>
}
----
<1> `onStageDrop` (optional): A callback function that is called when an element is dropped
onto the Stage. The callback receives a `DragEvent` object as a parameter.

onto the Stage. The callback receives a `File` object as a parameter and should return a
`Promise` that resolves when the file is uploaded.
