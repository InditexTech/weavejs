= WeaveTextToolAction

The **WeaveTextToolAction** action allows users to add new text nodes to the canvas
by clicking or touching on it. Once placed, the node becomes immediately editable,
enabling users to type inline and customize the content.

This action is perfect for adding labels, annotations, or descriptions in collaborative
environments. Created text nodes are fully interactive, styleable, and synchronized
across all connected users in real time.

After the node is added it can be edited by **double-click** or **double-touch** on it.
