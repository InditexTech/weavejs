= Visual Collaborative Web Applications

**Weave.js** is a modular JavaScript library that streamlines the development of
visual collaborative web applications built with an HTML5 canvas. Designed with a
robust architecture, **Weave.js** enables developers to extend functionality
seamlessly, supporting a wide range of custom nodes, actions and plugins.

It offers a clean and efficient API for:

- Rendering interactive nodes or graphics elements
- Managing layered content
- Handling user input
- Facilitating real-time multi-user collaboration.

Ideal for building applications such as diagram editors, whiteboards, and design
platforms, **Weave.js** provides the flexibility and scalability needed for modern,
canvas-based collaborative tools.
