= WeaveFitToScreenToolAction

The **WeaveFitToScreenToolAction** action automatically adjusts the zoom and position of
the Stage to ensure all visible nodes fit neatly within the viewport. It's perfect for
resetting the view, getting a quick overview of the entire workspace, or re-centering
after navigation.

When triggered finds the zoom level necessary to fit all the nodes of the canvas in the
viewport and center on them, so they can be entirely visible.
