= WeaveNodesSnappingPlugin

The **WeaveNodesSnappingPlugin** plugin adds smart alignment assistance by enabling
nodes to snap to guides or other nodes as they are moved or resized. It helps
users place elements with precision, improving layout consistency and visual structure.

Itâ€™s especially useful in design tools, diagram editors, and any interface where
visual alignment matters.
