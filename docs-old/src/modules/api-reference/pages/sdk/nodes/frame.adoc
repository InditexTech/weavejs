= Frame node

The Frame node is a container-like visual element used to group and organize other
nodes within a pre-defined boundary. It functions as a structured layout region, often
used to represent panels, sections, or modular components on the canvas.

Built using a combination of primitive shapes, the Frame node can include a title,
background, border, and optional interactive handles. It supports nesting of child
Nodes, making it ideal for modular UIs, flow sections, or structured diagrams.

On a frame you can add any node except for:

* A Frame itself
* A xref:api-reference:sdk/nodes/layer.adoc[Layer]
* A xref:api-reference:sdk/nodes/stage.adoc[Stage]
