= Stage node

The Stage node is the root canvas container in Weave.js. It serves as the entry point
for rendering all other visual or layout Nodes and manages the overall coordinate system.
Built on top of Konva’s Stage.

All Nodes are rendered within the Stage, making it the central hub for your visual
collaborative experience. It’s also where global behaviors—like grid rendering,
selection, or snapping—are initialized and managed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
We don't recommend to use this node directly. To define the application Stage,
use the stores `initialState` configuration property on server-side.
