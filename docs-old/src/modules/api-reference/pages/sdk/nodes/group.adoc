= Group node

The Group node is a container for organizing multiple nodes into a single, movable
and transformable unit. Based on Konvaâ€™s https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.Group.html[Group],
it allows you to nest shapes or other groups together, enabling you to apply
transformations like positioning, scaling, rotation,or selection as one unified object.

Groups are useful for structuring complex UIs, building reusable components, or
enabling drag-and-drop behavior across multiple elements. They help keep your canvas
scene organized and easier to manipulate programmatically.
