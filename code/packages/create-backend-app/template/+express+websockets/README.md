This is a Express.js application generated with **Create Weave.js Backend**

If you skipped the automatic installation of the dependencies, run first this
command:

```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
# or
yarn install
```

This server setup the Weave.js
[Azure WebSockets](https://inditextech.github.io/weavejs/docs/main/build/stores/websockets-store). So no special setup is needed.

Now, lets run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
yarn dev
```
